always be useful to those who are interested in the safe working of
Steam Boilers.</p>

<p>The following pages contain very brief abstracts of records obtained
for the Midland Steam Boiler Inspection and Assurance Company, by whose
permission they are now republished in a compact and convenient form.</p>

<p>By permission of the Council of the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the records are prefaced by a Paper
on Steam Boiler Explosions and their records, and on
Inspection as a means of prevention, read before that
Institution at Manchester, August 1st, 1866, and a further
Paper on the "Conclusions derived from the experience of
recent Steam Boiler Explosions," read before the same
Institution at Nottingham, August 3rd, 1870.</p>

<p class="smcap continued">and their Records, and on, Inspection as
a Means of Prevention, by Edward B. Marten, mem. inst. m.e. a.i.c.e.,

Whitworth, Esq., President, in the Chair. By permission of the

<hr class="minor" />

<p class="continued">The subject of Steam Boiler Explosions, which was
brought before this Institution in June, 1848, in a paper by the late
Mr. William Smith of Dudley in reference to an explosion near that
place, and again in 1859 in a paper by Mr. Longridge on the economy
and durability of stationary boilers, is one of great importance
and is now attracting increased attention. The first public notice
of the subject was by a parliamentary committee in 1817, which was
appointed in consequence of a very fatal boiler explosion in London in
1815; evidence was then collected as to steamboats, and many boiler
explosions were referred to. That committee recommended among other
things that boilers should be made of wrought iron, instead of cast
iron or copper, which had been the materials mainly used previously;
that they should be inspected and tested; and that there should be two
safety valves, each loaded to one third of the test pressure, under
penalties for any excess. A great part of the information now existing
upon the subject, especially in regard to the earlier explosions, is
to be found in the records of inquests after fatal cases; and some
of the careful reports of eminent engineers on those occasions have
materially assisted in the formation of correct views as to the causes
of explosion. Latterly also the printed reports of the inspectors
of mines, and more especially the reports of the explosions of
locomotives, illustrated by diagrams by the inspectors of railways,
have furnished very valuable information. Since the subject has been
taken up by private associations for the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span>

prevention of explosions, many more records have been published,
although their usefulness is much impaired by their not containing the
names of the places whereby the explosions could be identified.</p>

<p>When the writer's attention was first directed to this subject,
he met with great difficulty in obtaining correct records of boiler
explosions, from which to arrive at the results of past experience;
and wishing to base his own opinion on facts, rather than on the
inferences of others however reliable, he followed the example of
the Franklin Institute in their elaborate investigation of the subject,
and collected all the records he could find; and by way of
facilitating reference, arranged an index, a manuscript copy of
which is presented with the present paper to the Library of this
Institution. All must be agreed as to the importance of reliable
information on such accidents as boiler explosions; and the
writer would suggest that this Institution may materially aid in
obtaining the desired records and placing them within easy
access, by becoming the depository of reports on explosions, and by
inducing those who have the opportunity to forward copies of
reports, that these may be arranged so as to be easily found and
consulted. It is very desirable that these reports should as
far as possible be illustrated by sketches, as aids to the description;
and also by slight models like those now shown to the meeting,
by which the whole matter may be seen at a glance. So few
persons comparatively have the opportunity of examining boilers
after explosion, that the most erroneous ideas have prevailed,
and theories have been advanced which would soon be dissipated
by practical experience or by reading accurate reports. It would
also very much aid in the understanding of published matter on the
subject, if full descriptions of each case alluded to in illustration
could be obtained. These records are as useful to the engineer as
the "precedents" or "cases" to the lawyer or the surgeon. After
any serious explosion, the newspapers of the neighbourhood in
which it has occurred contain voluminous articles describing the
disastrous result and the damage done, which, although useful as
far as they go, do not in the least assist in arriving at the cause of
explosion. The really important particulars, such as the description

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span>

and construction of the boiler, its dimensions, and the pressure at
which it worked, are in most cases omitted altogether.</p>

<p>The record of explosions presented to the Institution contains
a list of the boiler explosions in each year of the present century,
as far as known to the writer, with the names of the places, and
the description and sizes of the boilers, and the supposed cause
of explosion, together with references to the books or papers from
which further information may be obtained. Of course many
of the explosions have to be put down as uncertain in some of the
particulars; but every year improves the record, as fresh information
is obtained, and with the assistance of the members of this
Institution it might be made far more perfect and extensive.</p>

<p>The theories as to the causes of explosion have been numerous. In
the early days of the steam engine, when the steam was used only as a
condensing medium and the pressure in the boiler was frequently allowed
to get below atmospheric pressure, many boilers were destroyed by the
excess of the external atmospheric pressure becoming too great, causing
them to be collapsed or crumpled up; and this led to the use of the
atmospheric valve still found on old boilers. Even so lately as last
year, 1865, a boiler in the neighbourhood of Bury, Lancashire, has
suffered in this way by collapse from external pressure; its appearance
after the accident is shown in <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, which is
copied from a photograph. The early explosions were so palpably due to
the weakness of the boilers, which compared with those of the present
day were most ill constructed, that no one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span>

thought of any other cause than the insufficient strength of the vessel
to bear the expansive force of the steam contained in it. When the
advantages of high-pressure steam became recognized, and the boilers
were improved so as to bear the increased strain, the tremendous
havoc caused by an explosion led many to think that something more
must be required than the expansive force of the steam to produce
such an effect; and they appear to have attributed to steam under
certain conditions a detonating force, or a sudden access of expansive
power that overcame all resistance. To support this somewhat natural
supposition, it was asserted that the steam became partially decomposed
into its constituent gases, forming an explosive mixture within the
boiler. That this belief is still sometimes entertained is seen from
the verdict of a jury even in the present year, 1866, in the case of
the explosion of a plain cylindrical boiler at Leicester, shown in
<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>, the real cause of which appears to have been
that the shell of the boiler was weakened by the manhole. It seems
hardly necessary to point out the fallacy of imagining decomposition
and recomposition of the steam to take place in succession in the
same vessel without the introduction of any new element for causing a
change of chemical combination; but it is necessary to refer to this
supposition, as the idea is shown to be not yet extinct.</p>

<p>Again it has been asserted that the steam when remaining quite
still in the boiler becomes heated much beyond the temperature due
to the pressure; and that therefore when it is stirred or mixed or
brought more in contact with the water by the opening of a valve
or other cause, the water evaporates so rapidly as to produce an
excessive pressure by accumulation of steam. In support of this view
the frequency of explosions upon the starting of the engine after a
short stand is adduced; but it is very doubtful whether by this means
a sufficient extra pressure could be produced to cause an explosion,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span>

unless the boiler had been previously working up to within a very
small margin of its strength. Explosions are seldom caused by a
sudden increase of pressure, but rather by the pressure gradually
mounting to the bursting point, when of course the effect is sudden
enough. Nor is it necessary in many cases to look for much increase
of pressure as the cause of explosion; for it is far more often the
case that the strength of the boiler has gradually degenerated by
wear or corrosion, until unable to bear even the ordinary working
pressure. It is so very easy, when examining the scene of an
explosion, for the first cause of rupture to be confounded with the
causes of the subsequent mischief, that in many cases erroneous
conclusions have been arrived at in this way.</p>

<p>The most important points to find out in connection with any
explosion are the condition of the boiler and all belonging to it
immediately before the explosion, together with the locality of the
first rent, the direction of the line of rupture, and the nature of the
fracture; as everything occurring after the instant of the first rent is
an effect and not a cause of explosion. As soon as the first rent has
taken place, the balance of strain in the fabric is disturbed, and
therefore the internal pressure has greatly increased power in
continuing the rupture; and also the pressure being then removed
from the surface of the water, which is already heated to the
temperature of the steam, the whole body of the water gives out its
heat in the form of steam at a considerable pressure, and thus
supplies the volume of steam for carrying on the work of
destruction. When thus quickly generated, the steam perhaps
carries part of the water with it in the same way that it does in
ordinary priming; and it has been thought by some that the
impact of the water is thus added to that of the steam, to aid in
the shock given to all surrounding obstacles.</p>

<p>It is seldom that one out of a bed of boilers explodes without
more or less injury to the others on either side of it; but sometimes
two boilers in one bed, or three, or even five, have exploded
simultaneously.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The causes of boiler explosions may be considered under the two
general heads of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span></p>

<p>Firstly, faults in the fabric of the boiler itself as originally
constructed, such as bad shape, want of stays, bad material,
defective workmanship, or injudicious setting:&mdash;and</p>

<p>Secondly, mischief arising during working, either from wear and
tear, or from overheating through shortness of water or accumulation
of scurf; or from corrosion, in its several forms of general thinning,
pitting, furrowing, or channelling of the plates; or from flaws or
fractures in the material, or injury by the effect of repeated strain;
or from undue pressure through want of adequate arrangements
for escape of surplus steam.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many of the early explosions were from faults
of construction. The stronger materials now used were then found so
difficult to manipulate that others easier to work were chosen, and
often the shape of the boiler was only selected as the one easiest to
make. The early boilers were made of copper or cast iron, with leaden
or even wooden tops, and of the weakest possible shape. Such was
the boiler used by Savery, shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, and
the Tun Boiler and Flange boiler, <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> and
<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>. The very fatal explosion in London in 1815,
referred to by the parliamentary commission previously named, was of a
cast-iron boiler, which failed because one side was too thin to bear
the pressure, as the casting was of irregular thickness. The steam being

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span>

at that time used only at or below atmospheric pressure as a means
of obtaining a vacuum by condensation for working by the external
pressure of the atmosphere, so little was pressure of the steam
thought of, that boilers were proposed and it is believed were
actually constructed with hooped wooden shells, like barrels, and
internal fireplaces and flues of copper; and even a stone chamber
was named as being a suitable shell for a boiler, with internal
fireplace and copper flue passing three times the length of the inside
and out at the top, like an ordinary stove and piping. These
boilers must have been something like the sketches given in
<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, and
were intended to be exposed only to the external pressure of the
atmosphere.</p>

</div>

<p>Cast iron was frequently used for the shell of boilers, with
an internal fireplace and tubes of wrought iron, as shown in
<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8.</a>, and boilers of this construction are still
to be found in use at some of the older works at the present day. As
the outside shell and front plate are 1&frac12; inch thick and are not
exposed to any wear at all, these boilers are sufficiently strong. A
duplicate front plate with set of tubes attached is always kept on
hand in case of need. Another form of cast-iron boiler is shown in
<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9.</a>, made in several parts put together with
flange joints, with an internal fireplace and flue also made of cast
iron. When cast iron was used for the parts exposed
to the fire in boilers intended for high pressure, it was sometimes
employed in the form of tubes of small diameter and proportionately
thinner; as in Woolf's boiler, so much spoken of in the evidence
before the parliamentary committee of 1817. This boiler, shown in
<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10.</a>, consisted of nine cast-iron pipes, about
1 foot diameter and 9 feet long, set in brickwork so that the flame
played all round them.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>

These small tubes were connected with another of larger size placed
transversely above them, forming a steam receiver, and this again with
a still larger one, which formed a steam chamber. No details of any
explosions of the three last mentioned boilers have been obtained; but
it is known that the cast iron was found a most treacherous material,
especially when exposed to the action of the fire; and that the effect
of explosion was very disastrous, because the boiler burst at once into
many pieces, each of which was driven out with great velocity, and the
danger was not mitigated by the circumstance of large masses holding
together, as is found to be the case with wrought-iron boilers when
exploded.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p>When wrought-iron boilers came into use the shapes were most varied,
and the dimensions much larger than before. One of the earliest was
the Wagon boiler, shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11.</a>, with round
top and plain flat sides, which could only be made to bear even the
smallest pressure by being strengthened with numerous stays. In most
cases of explosion of this class of boiler the bottom was torn off,
owing to the angle iron round it being weakened by the alternate
bending backwards and forwards under each variation of pressure, as all
the sides and the bottom must be constantly springing when at work.
Such was the explosion at Chester in 1822, and many others. This shape
was soon improved in its steam generating powers by making the sides
concave instead of flat, as shown in <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12.</a>, so
that the heating surface was greater and also in a better position to
receive the heat from the flame in the flues.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>

This shape was further elaborated by rounding the ends as in <a
href="#fig13">Fig. 13.</a>, and in some cases making the bottom convex
to correspond with the top, as in <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14.</a> All
these forms however still required numerous stays to retain them in
shape, the safety of the boiler being dependent upon the stays; and
numerous explosions show the weakness of these boilers. They generally
gave way at the bottom, as in an explosion that occurred at Manchester
in 1842, where the boiler had been weakened by frequent patching; they
also sometimes exploded through the failure of the stays.</p>

   <img src="images/i_018.png" alt="balloon boiler" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 18.</div>
</div>

<p>A very early improvement in the right direction consisted in making
the shell circular; and some few large boilers still exist that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span>

were made completely spherical, as show in <a href="#fig15">Fig.
15.</a>, so that the whole of the iron was exposed to tension only,
and required no assistance from stays, and the boiler had no tendency
to alter its shape under varying pressure. This shape however had the
great disadvantage of possessing the least amount of heating surface
for its size or cubic contents; and also it was very liable to injury
from sediment on the bottom, which accumulated on the most central
spot. The spherical form was therefore soon modified into the shape
shown in <a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>, by making the bottom more
shallow, although still convex; and afterwards by putting flat or
concave sides and a flat or concave bottom, with the angle constructed
either of bent plates or angle iron, as in <a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>
and <a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>, which represent the forms known so
well in the Staffordshire district as the common Balloon or Haystack
boiler.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">Pg 17</a></span>

Many of these have been made of very great size, measuring as much
as 20 feet diameter, and containing so much water and steam as to be
most formidable magazines for explosion. Perhaps no form of boiler has
exploded more than this, partly because of the great number that have
been used, but chiefly because of the inherent weakness of the shape.
The records however have not been obtained of the great majority of
these explosions, because they seldom caused sufficient damage or loss
of life to attract much attention, as these boilers generally worked
in isolated positions at collieries. The bottom is only prevented from
blowing down into the fireplace by numerous stays from the top, and the
angle iron round the bottom of the sides is much tried by the constant
springing of the plates under every alternation of pressure; and the
weakness thus occasioned is increased by the angle resting on the
brickwork and being exposed to corrosion. The effect of this continued
alternation of strain is well shown by the elastic model exhibited.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 22.</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the dependence of these boilers upon stays for their
strength, many have been made as large as 12 and 15 feet diameter
without stays; and explosion sooner or later has been the consequence.
Such was an explosion that took place at Smethwick in 1862, which is
shown in <a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>. As the force of the explosion
was only slight, the effect of the bottom giving way, and the
consequent rolling over caused by the reaction of the issuing steam and
water, is clearly seen.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">Pg 18</a></span>

Another example that occurred at Wednesbury in 1862 is shown in <a
href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>, where the explosion was rather more violent,
the bottom of the boiler being torn off all round and left upon the
firegrate, and rent nearly into two pieces; while the top and sides
were thrown some height in one mass, and were only put out of shape by
the fall. The weakness of this boiler had been further increased by
making the bottom angle of angle iron, as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span>

shown enlarged in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>, with a ring of flat
plate <strong>A</strong> interposed between the angle-iron ring and the
concave bottom of the boiler; so that all the effect of the springing
of the bottom, as shown by the dotted lines, was thrown upon the
angle iron, which was accordingly found cut off all round. Had the
concave bottom been made to rise direct from the angle iron, as in <a
href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>, the springing could not have been so great,
and the angle iron would only have had to stand the shearing strain
of retaining in its place the rigid bottom; but as about one foot all
round the bottom was flat, and the concavity was only in the central
part, the angle-iron ring had to bear an up and down strain, as shown
by the dotted lines in <a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>, and the bending
action was more severe than it would have been if the bottom had even
been made quite flat all over.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig23">
   <img src="images/i_020b.png" alt="Balloon boiler explosion" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 23.</div>
</div>

<p>A further form of the Balloon boiler is shown in
<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">Pg 20</a></span>

where the heating surface of the bottom is increased by an internal
central dome-shaped fireplace, with an arched and curved flue
conducting the flame through one revolution within the boiler before
passing again round the outside. This construction however must
necessarily have diminished the strength of the boiler greatly. In
the drawing the top of the boiler, as indicated by the dotted lines,
is removed to show the interior.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig24">
   <img src="images/i_021.png" alt="plain cylindrical boiler" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 24.</div>
</div>

<p>The desire to add to the strength of boilers by lessening the
diameter of the shell led to the construction of the Plain Cylindrical
boilers. They were made first with flat ends of cast iron, which
frequently cracked and gave way when exposed to the fire, as described
in many of the early American explosions. The flat ends when made of
wrought iron, as shown in <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>, are exposed to
the same strain as the bottom of the balloon and wagon boilers, and
are constantly springing with variation of pressure like drum heads,
causing injury to the angle-iron joint. They also require long stays
through them to hold in the ends, and these are subject to so much
vibration that they seldom continue sound for long together, especially
when joined with forked ends and cotters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figright" id="fig25">
   <img src="images/i_022.png" alt="cylindrical boiler with hemispherical ends" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
</div>

<p>As the flat ends of such boilers are always being sprung by
each alternation of pressure into a more or less spherical shape,
as shown by the elastic model exhibited, this consideration no
doubt led to the ends being made hemispherical, as shown in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>

<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>; and plain cylindrical boilers with these
hemispherical ends are now so commonly used that they far outnumber
any other form of boiler. Their shape renders them very strong, as
the whole of the iron is in simple tension, and internal pressure
has no tendency to alter the shape, as is shown by the elastic model
exhibited. There is one circumstance very much in favour of the plain
cylindrical boilers, and that is that they can be so easily cleaned and
repaired, as a man can stand properly at his work at every part and
the whole of the interior surface is exposed equally to view. They are
of course exposed to all the evils of boilers externally fired, the
part under greatest strain being weakened by the action of the fire;
and the bottom is also exposed to injury from accumulation of mud and
chips of scurf, which cannot be prevented from falling there, and lying
upon the part exposed to the direct action of the fire. When made of
great length, such as 70 or 80 feet, as is the practice for applying
the waste gas from blast furnaces, these boilers are also liable to
seam-rips or "broken backs," owing to the greater expansion of the
bottom exposed to the fierce flame for its whole length, than of the
top which is kept cooler by exposure to the air; and it would therefore
be better to have a succession of short boilers, rather than only a
single one, where great length is required.</p>

forming a Ring or Annular boiler. This boiler is shown in
<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>, and is 5 feet diameter with 25 feet external
diameter of the ring, or a mean length of about 63 feet; it has been
found to work well for some years, although exposed to the heat of six
puddling furnaces.</p>

<p>Explosions of plain cylindrical boilers have been very frequent
indeed, although they have not caused a proportionate number of deaths,
because they work usually in isolated positions at colliery and mine
engines. The sketch shown in <a href="#fig27">Fig. 27</a>, represents
an explosion that occurred at Darlaston in 1863, and illustrates the
way in which these boilers usually explode. They generally open first
at a longitudinal seam over the fire, which has become deteriorated by
accumulations of scurf preventing proper contact of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span>

water, so that the plates become overheated, their quality injured,
their edges cracked or burnt, and the rivets drawn or loosened. The
rent generally continues in the longitudinal direction to the sound
seam beyond the bridge at the one end, and at the other end
to the seam joining the front end to the shell; and then runs up each
of the transverse seams, allowing the rent part of the shell to open
out flat on both sides, and liberating both ends of the boiler, which
fly off in opposite directions. Of course it is seldom that an explosion
is quite so simple as this, as the direction of the flight of the various
pieces is so much influenced by the last part that held in contact
with the main body of the boiler. The want of due observation of
this point has often led to erroneous conclusions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig28">
   <img src="images/i_024.png" alt="upright boiler lower part blown out" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>
</div>

<p>In the explosion shown in <a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>, and in the
model exhibited, which occurred at Westbromwich in 1864, the lower part
of the side of an upright boiler was blown out; and the liberated part
was also divided into two pieces, each of which fell some distance
behind the boiler, in an opposite direction to the side from which they
came. The explanation of this became obvious on examination, as the
cause of the rupture had been the corrosion of the bottom, and the rent
had run up the seams until it met the angle iron of the side tubes,
round which it ran to the first seam above. This seam acted as a hinge
on which the ruptured pieces turned, and they swung round so violently
that they were wrenched off, but not before they had pulled the boiler
over and received the diverting force which gave them their direction,
for they flew off at a tangent, to the circle in which they had swung
round on the sound upper seam as upon a hinge.</p>

<p>In order to avoid having a large diameter for plain cylindrical
boilers, especially where exposed to the fire, boilers have been used
that have supplied the required steam power by a combination of several
cylinders of small diameter. One of these known as the Elephant boiler,
has been so much used in France that it is sometimes called the French
boiler; it is shown in <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>, and consists of
two cylinders of small diameter connected by upright conical tubes to a
large cylinder above. Another form called the Retort Boiler, shown in
<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>, has been described at a previous meeting
of this Institution (see Proceedings Inst. M. E. 1855 page 191). The
disadvantages of these two combinations of plain cylinders are that
they are not easy to clean or examine internally, and also there is
not free exit for the steam, which has to find its way along small
channels, and carries the water away with it, causing priming, and also
retarding the generation of steam and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>

endangering the boiler plates. With a view to strengthen the plain
cylinder made of wrought-iron plates, the seams are sometimes made
to run diagonally, as shown in <a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>, on the
principle that, as the longitudinal is the weakest seam and the
transverse the strongest, a diagonal between them gives the greatest
amount of strength to the boiler as a whole.</p>

<p>Plain cylindrical and wagon boilers have for many years been
made with internal tubes of various shapes and arrangement, through
which the flame passes to add to the heating surface. These are
shown in dotted lines on the previous drawings of wagon boilers,
<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> and <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>. They are
also shown in <a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>, where a tube passes from
over the fire to the front of a plain cylindrical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">Pg 26</a></span>

boiler; in <a href="#fig33">Fig. 33</a> two tubes pass from the sides
to the front: in <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a> the tube passes from the
back, but returns over the fire and passes again to the back: and in
<a href="#fig35">Fig. 35</a> a tube from the back passes out through a
cross tube in each side. The boilers in all these cases are fired
externally. This addition of tubes has tended very much to increase the
size of these boilers in order to make

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">Pg 27</a></span>

room for the tubes. These boilers are now found of 9, 10, and even 11
feet diameter; and this large shell being fired externally is exposed
to the same dangers as those described in the plain cylindrical boiler,
while it is not so easy to keep clean on account of the obstruction
offered by the internal flues. When the flame has passed under the
whole length of the bottom of these large boilers before going through
any tube, it is doubtful whether the heating surface of the tube helps
much in the generation of steam; but the tube is of use in reducing
the quantity of water in the boiler, as it occupies a considerable
space.</p>

        blown off and sides partially flattened" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 36.</div>
</div>

<p>Explosions of these boilers have sometimes taken place by collapse
of the tubes, but much more generally by the failure of the shell
over the fire, as shown in the sketch <a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>,
representing an explosion that occurred at Wolverhampton in 1865, in
which the first rent took place in a seam over the fire where frequent
repair had led to a considerable length of longitudinal seam being in
one continuous line. The four plates over the fire parted and opened
out until they had ripped two seams completely

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">Pg 28</a></span>

round the boiler; and the plates were thrown in one flat piece, as
shown, upon a bank behind. The main body of the boiler with the
tubes was turned over, and the front end blown away.</p>

   <img src="images/i_029a.png" alt="Butterley boiler" />

<p>A modification or amalgamation of several of the forms of boilers
already mentioned led to the construction known as the Butterley
boiler, shown in <a href="#fig37">Fig. 37</a>, with a wagon-shaped end
over the fire, continued in a single tube within a plain cylindrical
shell beyond. This boiler has been found to generate steam very
rapidly; but the extreme weakness of the construction over the fire
and along the tube, especially at the part where the front end of the
tube widens out in a bell mouth to meet the wagon-topped fireplace,
has led to so many explosions that few boilers are now made of this
form. A very early explosion that occurred at Edinburgh in 1821 was of
a boiler somewhat of this shape, only that the wagon-topped fireplace
was much longer. Other explosions of this form of boiler occurred at
Ashton-under-Lyne in 1845, at Wolverhampton in 1854, and at Tipton in
1856.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 41.</div>
</div>

<p>The desire to economise fuel led to placing the fire inside
the boiler, in a tube running from end to end, as shown in
<a href="#fig38">Fig. 38</a>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">Pg 29</a></span>

and the great number of boilers of this form used in Cornwall gave it
the name of the Cornish boiler. The exceedingly good duty performed by
these boilers led many to believe them the most perfect for economy
and durability; but the great number of explosions, or more properly
of collapsed flues, that have happened, have altered this opinion, and
led to the double-flue boiler shown in <a href="#fig39">Fig. 39</a>, in
which not only is the heating surface increased but the strength also,
by having two tubes of smaller diameter in the same shell. There are
a great many varieties of the two-tube boiler, which have been made
for the purpose of obtaining various particular results. In some cases
the two tubes have been made to unite into a single tube immediately
behind the fires, forming what is known as the Breeches-tube boiler,
as shown in <a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>, and in other instances
the outside shell of the boiler has been made oval, as shown in
<a href="#fig41">Fig. 41</a>, with the two tubes continued through from
end to end.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">Pg 30</a></span>

The heating surface has also been increased, and the strength of the
main tubes, by placing smaller transverse tubes across them at right
angles; but these advantages are gained by increased complication,
leading of course to greater difficulty in examination and repair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figright" id="fig42">
   <img src="images/i_032.png" alt="boiler with a collapsed flue" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 42.</div>
</div>

<p>The frequent failure of tubes by collapse when used for high
pressures, and also the results of careful experiments, led to
the simple addition of strengthening rings of different makes
around the exterior of these tubes, by which the shell and the
tubes are rendered of equal strength. It has taken considerable
time for the belief in the weakness of large tubes when exposed to
external pressure to become general, and a great many boilers
are still made and used having even large tubes without the
strengthening rings; and in some districts such boilers are used in
great numbers and at far higher pressures than can be considered
judicious. In more than one bed of boilers, one boiler after
another has exploded by the collapse of the tube from the want
of strengthening rings, and yet these have still been believed
unnecessary; and the cases of isolated boilers of this construction
where the large tubes have collapsed are extremely numerous, yet
any other reason than the weakness of the tube has been considered
more probable as the cause of explosion. A sketch of a boiler

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">Pg 31</a></span>

with collapsed flue is given in <a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, which
exploded at Burton-on-Trent in 1865; and it is selected from many
others because it was a new boiler, well made and mounted, and was a
good example of the weakness of a large tube to resist high external
pressure when made of great length without the support of strengthening
rings.</p>

<p>There are a great many advantages in the tubular boiler internally
fired. The shell which is exposed to the greatest tension is not also
exposed to the first action of the fire. The fire is in the midst of
the water, so that the greatest effect is obtained from it; and the
heating surface immediately over the fire, from which most steam
is generated, has not so great a depth of water above it for the
steam to pass through as in the externally fired boilers heated from
the bottom. The tubes also act as stays to the ends; and the mud
in the water falls off the tubes, where it would do mischief, and
settles on the bottom, where it is comparatively harmless.</p>

<p>These tubular boilers are however subject to disadvantages
peculiarly their own. It is not so easy to move about within them
for cleaning and examination as in the plain cylindrical boiler, as
the tubes fill up the space so much. The difference of expansion
between the highly heated tube and the comparatively cool shell
produces a strain, which causes the ends to bulge out; or if the ends
are made rigid, the strain sets up a contortion in the tube, which
causes furrowing of the plates by making the iron softer or more
susceptible of corrosion in certain lines of strain. Notwithstanding
these drawbacks however this form of boiler is an excellent one.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 44.</div>
</div>

<p>Many modifications in the forms of boilers have been made to
enable the manufacturers to use the waste heat from various
processes, especially from the making of iron. The plain cylindrical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span>

boiler has been used in this way, with sometimes as many as eight
puddling furnaces made to work upon one boiler. One of the earliest
special arrangements for this purpose was the Upright boiler with
central tube, shown in <a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>, which was
originally made for two furnaces; and about 7 feet diameter and 16
feet high. The size has since been increased to 10 feet diameter and
28 feet high, as shown in <a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>. These boilers
are made for one, two, three, or four puddling furnaces; and consist of
a cylinder with spherical ends, standing upright, with a central tube
from the bottom to about half the height, into which the side tubes
join. The heat from each furnace plays over a portion of
the shell, and then passes through the side tubes and down the centre
tube into the underground flue to the chimney.</p>

<p>These boilers have many good points: there is great heating
surface; and the shell being heated all round does not strain the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">Pg 33</a></span>

plates and seams by unequal expansion so much as in the horizontal
plain cylindrical boiler heated only at the bottom; and as both ends
are spherical there is no alteration of shape under internal pressure.
Moreover in consequence of the upright position of the boiler
a safe depth of water can easily be maintained, and yet the steam is
taken off so high above its surface that there is little priming; and
every part can most easily be cleaned and examined, as a man can
stand upright both in the boiler and in the flues. But the great
drawback to this class of boilers is that they must stand in the midst
of the workmen; so that, although they are not more liable to
explode than any other form of boiler, yet when they do burst they
necessarily endanger more lives than is usually the case with other
boilers that can be placed more away from the men employed at the
works. Should anything arise with the boiler to make it desirable
to withdraw the fire, this cannot be done without much delay, as the
furnaces have to be stopped and the iron run out. Also an explosion
can hardly happen without some of the melted iron being scattered
among the men at work.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 46.</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the most fatal explosions of these boilers have arisen from
careless construction. Such was the case in an explosion at Dudley
in 1862, shown in <a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>, where the crown plate forming

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>

the top of the centre tube was attached to the sides of the tube by
so slight an angle iron, as shown enlarged in <a href="#fig46">Fig.
46</a>, that the pressure of steam on the flat crown plate fairly
sheared the angle iron through, and allowed the plate to be blown
down the centre tube into the chimney flue, whereupon the boiler was
violently thrown off its seating by the reaction of the issuing steam
and water thus liberated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The double-tube horizontal boiler is also used in connection with
iron-making furnaces in many places, one furnace working into each
tube. Although by this arrangement the boiler can be placed a
little further from the workmen, some very fatal explosions have
happened to such boilers, as at Masborough in 1862.</p>

<p>Single-furnace boilers have been much used in the form of a
single-tube boiler standing on end, as shown in <a href="#fig47">Fig.
47</a>, with the flame passing up the tube, which is continued in the
form of a chimney on the top of the boiler. The tube passes through the
steam at the top, so that the plate is not protected from overheating
by contact with water; and this has caused explosion in some instances,
although the tube has been lined on the inside with firebrick to shield
the plate from the flame. Another great disadvantage of this Chimney
boiler is that the space between the tube and the shell is so narrow
that it is almost impossible to examine or clean it internally.</p>

boiler, shown in <a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>, where the two
difficulties mentioned in the previous boiler are avoided.</p>

<p>Many internally fired upright boilers of various shapes have been

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">Pg 35</a></span>

constructed to suit various purposes. One of a large size that has been
at work many years is shown in <a href="#fig49">Fig. 49</a>, with an
internal fireplace and a suspended cone and cross tube for increasing
the heating surface. This boiler is set in brickwork in such a way that
the heat passes through the side tubes and round the exterior shell
before going off to the chimney.</p>

</div>

<p>A very fatal explosion at Stoke-upon-Trent, in 1863, resulted from
an attempt to work a boiler of somewhat the same general form, but
without the same careful attention to the details of construction.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">Pg 36</a></span>

This boiler is shown in <a href="#fig50">Fig. 50</a>; the internal
fireplace is of conical shape, 4 ft. 6 ins. diameter on the top and
6 ft. 10 ins. at bottom, and was joined to the external shell by a
flat annular bottom. Almost the first time it was worked at high
pressure the conical fireplace collapsed, breaking off at the seam at
the top of the cone, and blowing down upon the grate, as shown in <a
href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>. The flat bottom was then left without the
support of the cone and side tubes, and gave way all round the outside
angle iron; and the top flew up a great height into the air, and fell
a crumpled heap, as shown in the sketch. In this case the only wonder
is that a boiler of such weak construction worked at all without
explosion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There yet remains to be noticed a very large and varied class of
boilers that have been designed with the express object of avoiding
explosion. Some of these, made of cast-iron pipes of small diameter,
have already been referred to. When steam carriages were first
constructed, boilers were tried made of a cluster of small pipes, set
both upright and horizontally, connected with a general receiver
and with each other by still smaller pipes. These were found to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">Pg 37</a></span>

have such small circulation of water that they very soon burnt out,
and also led to much priming. Afterwards, narrow chambers made
of corrugated plates set like the cells of a battery were tried, but
without much success. The multitubular boilers of the locomotive
type soon superseded all others as quick steam generators, and
until lately they have been considered as almost absolutely safe from
explosion. It is found however that the barrel of these boilers is
peculiarly liable to furrowing, owing to the strain weakening the
iron in certain lines. Perhaps no boiler shows more clearly than
the locomotive how necessary it is that every part should be open
to examination; and also how unwise it would be to use for
stationary purposes small cramped up boilers, only intended to
meet the necessities of locomotion. Many explosions of locomotive
boilers have taken place; but it is not necessary to give details in
this paper, as they are fully given in the published official reports
of the government inspectors.</p>

<p>Among the form of boilers designed to obtain very rapid
generation of steam, combined with increased safety from explosion,
may be specially named that consisting of a system of small pipes
within a shell with an artificial circulation of water, and also the
boiler consisting of a cluster of cast-iron spheres, both of which
have been described at previous meetings of the Institution (see
Proceedings Inst. M. E. 1861 page 30, and 1864 page 61); but
neither has been much used in this country at present. The boilers
also which consist chiefly of small tubes hanging down into the fire,
with smaller tubes or other arrangements within them for securing
a natural circulation, deserve mention, as they appear successfully
to accomplish that end.</p>

<p>The principle of all these small boilers appears to be that only
a small quantity of water should be contained in them, so that there
should not be a reservoir of danger in the shape of a mass of highly
heated water ready to be converted into steam if a rupture takes
place: and it cannot be denied that this is an advantage. But on the
other hand these boilers of small capacity, which evaporate their
whole contents in a few minutes, are subject to new dangers from

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">Pg 38</a></span>

that very cause; and although admirably adapted for purposes
where steam is wanted quickly on a sudden emergency, as in the
case of fire engines, or where the generating power required varies
each moment, as in the locomotive, they are for the most part ill
adapted for ordinary stationary purposes, such as the mill or the
colliery. They require constant firing and vigilant attention to the
feed, and cannot be left for a time with safety like the ordinary
stationary boilers. It has to be borne in mind also that the very
reservoir of danger so much dreaded is also a reservoir of power,
which assists in the steady maintenance of the machinery in motion.
The large mass of water heated to the evaporating point, the heated
brickwork of the flues, and the large fireplace, are so many assistances
to regularity, and enable the man in charge to attend to his other
duties without the risk of spoiling the boiler or letting down the
steam by a few minutes' absence from the stoke hole. Steam
employers are found at present to prefer the known dangers of the
large boilers to the supposed safety of small boilers, which they
fear are troublesome in practice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many of the early boilers were rendered weak by the injudicious
manner of arranging the seams. The longitudinal seams were made in a
continuous line from end to end, as shown in <a href="#fig24">Fig.
24</a>, page 20, with the transverse seams also continued completely
round the boiler, so that at the corner of each plate there were
four thicknesses of iron. The crossing of the seams, as in
<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>, page 21, adds much to the strength, and also
often prevents a rent from continuing forward to a dangerous extent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig52">
   <img src="images/i_040.png" alt="faulty rivetting" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 52.</div>
</div>

<p>It is scarcely requisite to mention the necessity of good material
and workmanship to secure strength in a boiler, however perfect
the design. If the plates are of weak and brittle iron, or imperfectly
manufactured, they will never make a good boiler. Apart from the
strain upon the boiler when at work, the iron has to undergo the
strain of the necessary manipulation, shaping, and punching,
during the construction of the boiler. If the plates forming the
boiler are not well fitted to their places before the rivet holes are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">Pg 39</a></span>

made, the errors have to be partially rectified by using the drift in
the holes to an unwarrantable extent, and then using imperfect
rivets to fill up the holes that do not correspond with each other;
and the mischief is too frequently increased afterwards by excessive
caulking, in the endeavour to stop the leaking which is sure to show
itself. In this way a boiler is often exposed to most unequal internal
strain between its several parts before it is set to work at all; and
when the heat is applied to it, the mere expansion causes undue
contortion, and leads to seam rips, and ultimately to disaster.
Several specimens of faulty rivetting and caulking were exhibited to
the meeting, and a sketch of one of them is shown in
<a href="#fig52">Fig. 52</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The strength of a boiler is often very much lessened by the
injudicious manner in which the mountings are fixed upon the boiler,
and many explosions are the consequence of this defect. Not only are
a great many holes for fittings cut out of the boiler in one line,
but these holes are made needlessly large. Steam domes are often so
placed as greatly to weaken the shell of the boiler, the hole cut out
of the plate being made the full diameter of the dome; and in some
cases the domes or steam chests have been made square or rectangular,
so as to weaken the shell still more, as shown in <a href="#fig53">Fig.
53</a>.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 54.</div>
</div>

<p>Manholes are often a source of danger, if not properly arranged
and duly strengthened. Even in very small boilers they are often
placed with the longest diameter in the longitudinal direction of the
boiler, so that the shell is greatly weakened, as in the sketch,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">Pg 40</a></span>

<a href="#fig54">Fig. 54</a>, of an exploded boiler at Walsall in 1865.
This boiler was 5 ft. 3 ins. long and 2 ft. 6 ins. diameter, and yet
the manhole was 18 inches by 13 inches, and placed within a few inches
of one end. The end was fastened in by angle iron, which was
not welded, and consequently there was so little strength at the small
portion of the shell between the end and the manhole that it gave way
and liberated the end and the manhole lid, after which the main body of
the boiler was thrown by the reaction across several streets to a great
distance.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig55">
   <img src="images/i_041b.png" alt="manhole exploded through plate" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 55.</div>
</div>

<p>A somewhat similar injudicious arrangement of the manhole is shown
in <a href="#fig55">Fig. 55</a>, where a manhole 17 inches by 14 inches
was cut out of the flat top of a steam dome only 2 ft. 6 ins. diameter,
without any strengthening ring to compensate for it. The repeated
strain of screwing up the manhole lid, combined with the pressure of
the steam, caused the lid to force its way out through the plate and
blow away. This explosion occurred at Birmingham in 1865.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding examples have shown how explosions often result
from faults in the construction of boilers; and the following instances
illustrate the explosions caused by mischief arising during working.
A boiler perhaps more than any other structure is subject to wear
and tear; and let it be worked ever so carefully, it will seriously
deteriorate. The wonder is, considering the work they have to
perform, that so many boilers are found which have worked twenty,
thirty, or even fifty years without explosion. The terms wear and
tear however are too vague for this subject, and the mischief met
with must be considered under distinct heads.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the thing most to be dreaded for boilers
is corrosion; because when the plate is once thinned, it cannot be
strengthened again, but must remain permanently weakened.
Corrosion the more deserves attention because it is easily detected by
moderate vigilance, and can generally be prevented by moderate care,
or by the boilers being so arranged that they can be readily examined
in every part. Corrosion has been the direct and unmistakeable cause
of a very large proportion of the explosions that have happened:
it occurs both inside and outside the boiler, according to circumstances,
and attacks the iron in various ways and in different places.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Internal corrosion</em> sometimes takes place from bad feed water, and
its effects are different in extent in the different parts of the same
boiler. It very seldom thins the plate over a large surface regularly,
but attacks the iron in spots, pitting it in a number of holes. These
are sometimes large, as if gradually increasing from a centre of
action; and sometimes small, but so close together as to leave very
little more space whole than that which is attacked. A very curious
example of the latter was exhibited to the meeting, and shown in
<a href="#fig56">Fig. 56</a> and <a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a>, cut from
the lower part of the shell of a large tubular boiler externally fired.
The corrosion was greatest along that part of the shell most exposed to
heat, and was so extensive that two boilers exploded simultaneously.
The boilers had been at work sixteen years, but the corrosion commenced
about eight years before the explosion, when the feed water was
rendered corrosive by being obtained from some iron mines.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">Pg 42</a></span>

This explosion occurred at Aberaman in 1864. The corrosion had been
seen going on for years, and was not considered sufficient to cause
danger; but the depth to which it extended through the thickness of
the metal is seen in the half size section, <a href="#fig15">Fig.
57</a>. Another sample equally curious was exhibited
to the meeting, and shown in <a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a> and
<a href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a>, taken from the sweep plate over the fire in
a plain cylindrical boiler which had worked about ten years.</p>

<p class="continued">The feed water was occasionally bad, and attacked
the iron over the area <strong>DDD</strong>, where unprotected by
scale. The protection afforded by scale against occasional corrosive
feed water is worthy of notice. In the two specimens exhibited it is
seen that the protection has been perfect where the scale has not been
chipped off; and the edge of the sound part projects over the hollow, as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">Pg 43</a></span>

seen in the half size sections, <a href="#fig57">Fig. 57</a> and <a
href="#fig59">Fig. 59</a>, the corrosive water having eaten away a
larger area beneath than that through which it first entered the
surface of the iron.</p>

<p>Internal corrosion is frequently observed where boilers are fed
from canals or streams in the neighbourhood of chemical works
from which corrosive matter is discharged at intervals into the
water. The corrosion takes place in isolated spots, but causes deep
holes; which seems to be accounted for on the supposition that the
scale previously upon the plate cracks during the cooling of the
boiler for cleaning, and forms a blister, so that a piece of about
2 inches area is raised slightly from the iron. When the boiler is
again put to work, this blister becomes filled with the corrosive
water, which is held there without circulation and causes corrosion.
When the boiler is again emptied these blisters may be seen, and if
broken show the blackened water and the injured surface. In

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>

future working each of these blisters forms a constant unprotected
point for attack. It is frequently seen further that such corrosion
is arrested if water be used which deposits scurf; but fresh blisters
and renewed corrosion will result from a return to the use of the
bad water.</p>

<p>The internal corrosion called furrowing has proved a frequent
cause of explosion, especially in locomotive boilers. It differs from
other corrosion by being in deep narrow continuous lines with abrupt
edges. It will sometimes go completely through a plate; and is
found where a sudden change of thickness occurs, either along the
lines of the seams, or opposite the edge of angle-iron attachments.
This effect is supposed to be due to the alternate springing of
the plates under each variation of the pressure or temperature,
causing the line of least resistance to receive a strain somewhat
similar to that produced by bending a piece of iron backwards
and forwards for the purpose of breaking it. This line of injury
is exposed to constant attack from corrosion, because the scurf is
always thrown off from it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>External corrosion</em> is a far more frequent cause of explosion in
stationary boilers; and it arises from many causes. The most
frequent cause, although the most easily detected, is leakage from
the joints of the fittings on the top of the boiler, which are too
frequently attached by bolts instead of rivets. This evil is much
increased when the boilers are covered with brickwork, which holds
the water against the plates, and hides the mischief from observation.
It is astonishing to find how much damage is allowed in this
way to go on without attention, until the tops of boilers are
corroded so thin that little holes burst through. These are
sometimes found stopped with wooden pegs or covered by screwed
patches of plate, either of which cause leakage that hastens the
mischief, as shown by the sample exhibited. Boilers exposed to the
weather will of course become corroded like anything else made of
iron and not painted; and yet so much mischief is sometimes caused
by leakage beneath improper covering that exposure may almost

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span>

be said to be the smaller evil of the two, as it is better to see what
is going on than to rest in false security. No covering will be
found cheaper, or better, in the long run, than a roof, which prevents
the loss of heat by exposure, and yet allows free access to all the
fittings and joints on the top of the boiler.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig60">

   <img src="images/i_047.png" alt="plate cross section showing corrosion" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 61.</div>
</div>

<p>Some examples of the evils of covering can be given that have
come under the writer's observation. A set of boilers had been well
covered by arches of brickwork, so built as to keep out all water,
and also set so as to touch the boilers only at intervals, leaving a
space generally of a few inches. After about seven years' working,
the whole of the tops of the boilers were discovered to be dangerously
thin, and had to be renewed. The cause was leakage from the
joints of fittings and seams of the boilers, and the issuing steam had
been drawn along the space between the boilers and the arches, and
had escaped at a place where it had not attracted notice. In another
case, a somewhat similar set of boilers were covered with ashes, to
prevent the loss of heat by radiation; and the rain and the leakage
beneath the ashes, in conjunction with the corrosive matter from the
ashes themselves, thinned the tops of the boilers to a dangerous
extent in less than two years. A sketch of the corrosion caused in
this instance by covering with ashes is shown in <a href="#fig60">Fig.
60</a> and <a href="#fig61">Fig. 61</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" id="fig62">

<div class="figright" id="fig63">
   <img src="images/i_047c.png" alt="cross section of corroded plate" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 63.</div>
</div>

<p>Similar mischief has been noticed in boilers covered with
sand, as shown in the sketches <a href="#fig62">Fig. 62</a> and
<a href="#fig63">Fig. 63</a>, which represent an instance of corrosion
after eight years' working; although nothing forms a better covering
than sand for preventing loss of heat by radiation. In both these
examples it will be seen that the corrosion has continued until the
thickness of the plate has been so eaten away that a hole has been
burst out at <strong>SS</strong>. A very good covering is formed by
brickwork in cement; or various cements made for the purpose, which
adhere to the surface of the plate and yet show leakage; or such
materials as sacking or felt; or sheet-iron casing, leaving about 6
inches of air space all round the boiler.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>

But all these have the great objection that they hide the boiler
from inspection, except by the expensive process of removing the
covering; and in this way dangers that have caused explosion
have remained hidden from observation.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 65.</div>
</div>

<p>Explosions have also taken place from general corrosion of the
surface of the boilers in the flues. A new boiler which was set on
sidewalls built upon a foundation of porous rock was found to have
become corroded all along the bottom in less than two years, owing
to the dampness which rose from the foundations causing a constant
presence of vapour. The corrosion was peculiar, and more like that
found on old iron left for a long time in a damp place; for the iron
plate fell to pieces when touched, and large flakes could be raised
from the surface, and the greater part of the thickness of the plate
could be removed with the fingers. Somewhat similar corrosion had taken
place in a boiler which exploded at Loughborough in 1863; the bottom
of the shell became rent at the corroded part, and as the fracture
continued spirally round the boiler several times, nearly all the shell
was peeled off in the curious manner shown in <a href="#fig64">Fig.
64</a>. The explosion shown in <a href="#fig65">Fig. 65</a>, which
occurred at Leeds in 1866, also arose from corrosion of the bottom of
the boiler.</p>

   <img src="images/i_050.png" alt="channelling" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 67.</div>
</div>

<p>The greater part of the corrosion found in the side flues of
boilers is caused by the leakage of seams. Many boilers are emptied
for cleaning as soon as work is over on Saturday night, and long
before the brickwork of the fireplaces and flues has cooled; and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>

consequently, the boiler, having no water in it, is made much hotter
than it ever is in working, and the seams are injured and sprung
and the rivets loosened by the extra expansion so caused. This is
sometimes done intentionally, in order to loosen the scale by the
greater expansion of the iron than of the scurf. When the boiler is
again set to work, the seams and rivets leak and cause that corrosion
which is called channelling. This has been observed to occur to
such an extent that all the seams in a boiler have been seen thus
corroded; and the same has sometimes been found in all the boilers in
a large manufactory. Specimens of this channelling were exhibited to
the meeting. One in particular, shown in <a href="#fig66">Fig.
66</a> and <a href="#fig67">Fig. 67</a>, deserves attention, as it
shows the effect of a jet of steam and water from the leaking rivet
<strong>R</strong>, in cutting a series of channels into the plate
along the course of the dotted lines <strong>EEE</strong>, and
producing a hole in the plate at <strong>S</strong>. This corrosion had
been going on for about four years, but was in a part of the boiler
seldom seen in ordinary examination.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span>

Many explosions have resulted from this form of corrosion; for when a
rent is once made, the fracture continues along the thinned channel of
the plate.</p>

<p>The corrosion most to be dreaded, because most difficult to
detect, is that which takes place where the boiler is in contact
with brickwork; and it is found alike in all forms of boilers set in
brickwork. When found at the part where the side flues are gathered in
at the top against the boiler, it is usually occasioned by the leaking
of fittings or feed pipes, or by rain being allowed to run between the
boiler and the brickwork. More than one explosion has been caused
by the droppings from a roof being allowed to fall upon the tops of
the flues. When the corrosion is found at the point where the bottom
flue walls touch the boiler, it is frequently caused by the leaking of
seams that have been strained by the weight of the boiler; and this
often arises from want of care to replace the brickwork, after repair
of the boiler or flues, in such a position as to take again its proper
proportion of the weight of the boiler. Cases have been met with where
the shape of the bottom of large boilers has been quite altered by such
means. The brackets on the sides of heavy boilers have not only been
strained so that the rivets or bolts have leaked and caused corrosion,
but they have also bent or cracked the side plates of the boiler. The
bracket shown at <strong>B</strong> in <a href="#fig53">Fig. 53</a>,
page 40, made of only an angle iron with a piece of plate attached, is
especially liable to cause injury if the brickwork is not rebuilt close
up to the angle iron, as the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span>

leverage is so great. This is avoided by the better form of bracket
shown at <strong>C</strong>, consisting of an elbow of flat bar-iron
rivetted at top and bottom to the boiler.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig68">
   <img src="images/i_051.png" alt="corrosion on boiler" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 68.</div>
</div>

<p>In the old balloon and wagon boilers, the angle where the bottom
joined the sides scarcely ever remained sound for long when in contact
with the brickwork, and many of those that exploded have been found
almost corroded through where they stood upon the brickwork. The
explosion before alluded to and shown in <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>,
was caused by corrosion of the bottom of the boiler where it was set on
the brickwork. Many boilers are so set that the brickwork of the flues
is made to follow the shape of the boiler, with as little space between
as possible; but the slight advantage gained in increased heating
effect is far outweighed by the impossibility of getting into the flues
for examination. It is only by having the flues sufficiently roomy
that proper examination can be made, and that the indications on the
brickwork of leaking can be seen and remedied, and corrosion arrested.
A remarkable case of corrosion occurred in a boiler with an oval
shell, set upon a middle wall. The flues were too narrow for a man
to enter, and a leak in the bottom was only discovered by the boiler
nearly running empty while the engine pumps were standing for a short
time. It was subsequently found that the whole bottom where it rested
on the wall was extensively corroded in a continuous line, and that
explosion was only prevented by the numerous stays across the bottom to
compensate for the oval shape. <a href="#fig68">Fig. 68</a>, shows the
position and extent of the corrosion, and the plate was completely in
holes at the parts indicated by the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>

black marks. This corrosion was supposed to have been going on
for about three years.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig69">

   <div class="caption">Fig. 71.</div>
</div>

<p>It is sometimes asserted that corrosion cannot be the cause of an
explosion, because the corroded place would simply give way and let off
the steam harmlessly, or at least the boiler would not be displaced
from its seating. When the corrosion is only local, and surrounded by
sound plates of sufficient strength to arrest the extension of the
fracture, this may be the case, as in an explosion at Sheffield in
1865, shown in <a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a>, where a piece of plate
was blown out on one side of the boiler, allowing the steam and water
to escape without displacing the boiler; the thickness of the plate
at that part had been reduced to 1/8th inch by corrosion
in about 1&frac12; years, which had been caused by leakage at the seams
from inefficient repair with bolts instead of rivets, and also from
the moisture having been allowed to be kept against the plate by the
brickwork. But even under such circumstances, if the piece
blown out should be from the bottom, the whole boiler may be thrown a
great distance by the reaction of the issuing steam, as in an explosion
at Leeds in 1865, shown in <a href="#fig70">Fig. 70</a>. If the corrosion

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span>

extends for any length, the first rent is almost sure to continue
until a complete explosion is the result. Several of the small models
exhibited to the meeting showed the line of fracture in various cases
of explosion. One showed the appearance of a plain cylindrical
boiler after explosion caused by corrosion along the whole length where
it rested on brickwork; this explosion occurred at Wigan in 1865, and
a sketch of it is given in <a href="#fig71">Fig. 71</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig72">
   <img src="images/i_054a.png"
        alt="section of a pocket in a boiler wall" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 72.</div>
</div>

<p>Many explosions of boilers have been caused by accumulation of
scurf. The mischief is not so much from scurf being gradually
deposited all over the interior of the boiler to a dangerous thickness
as from the chips off the sides falling in heaps on the bottom. The
plate beneath this accumulation becomes overheated, because not in
contact with the water, and softens and sinks down into a "pocket,"
which if unnoticed will soon burn quite through. If the scurf that
has caused the mischief is thick and hard enough to resist the
pressure for a little time, the hole enlarges, until the scurf suddenly
gives way and allows the contents to issue so violently as to disturb
the boiler, or at least to blow the fire out of the grate. Such was
an explosion at Bilston in 1863, where a large plain cylindrical
boiler, 9 ft. diameter, was heated by three large fires placed side by
side along the bottom; and a large "pocket" burst out over the third
grate, and scalded the attendant to death. A similar pocket in a
boiler, 4ft. 6 ins. diameter, which exploded at Dudley in 1864, after
having been at work six weeks without cleaning, is shown in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span>

transverse section, <a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a>. In this case the
scurf had filled up the circle of the boiler to a depth of 3 inches
at the bottom, as shown in the drawing, and was of a very hard
description; and the boiler plate was bent out in a gradual curve,
and thinned to about 1/16 inch, the original thickness being &frac12;
inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig73">
   <img src="images/i_054b.png" alt="accumulated scurf" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 73.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The whole bottom of a boiler is sometimes injured, and the plates
buckled and the seams sprung, from the accumulation of mud. One case
may be mentioned where the water was very full of mud, and the boilers
were worked day and night during the week but stopped for several hours
on Sunday, during which time the deposit of mud was so thick that it
did not get thoroughly disengaged again from the bottom when the boiler
was set to work, but hardened into a mass. Although many of these
pockets and injuries to the plates may occur without serious damage,
they sometimes cause that first rent which destroys the equilibrium of
the structure and leads to explosion. Some of the specimens of scurf
exhibited to the Meeting show that their thickness is made up of small
chips, carelessly left after cleaning or fallen from the sides of the
boiler, as seen in <a href="#fig73">Fig. 73</a>, or from cotton waste
or other matter left in the boiler

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span>

and forming a nucleus for the scurf to accumulate upon. Other
specimens show that foreign matter must have been put into the
boiler to stop leaking.</p>

<p>Accumulations of scurf in the feed pipes at the point of entrance
into the boiler have also caused explosion by stopping the supply of
water. The same result is caused by the freezing of the water in
the pipes which are exposed, and each winter one or two boilers are
injured or exploded from this cause, especially small household
boilers placed behind kitchen grates. Scurf cannot be considered
so great an evil as corrosion, since it can be removed, and if this is
done in time, the boiler is restored to its original condition.</p>

<p>The advantage of a pure water, which does not deposit scurf, is
so great for the supply of boilers that it is always worth while to
go to considerable expense for obtaining it; or to take some steps
for purifying the feed water as much as possible. If it is only mud
mechanically suspended, which would deposit by gravity on the
bottom of the boiler, frequent use should be made of the blow-off
apparatus. If the impurity is light enough to be carried to
the surface in the form of scum, the blow-off apparatus should
discharge from the surface of the water as well as from the bottom.
If the impurity is chemically suspended in the water, some
one of the many substances which form the refuse from various
manufactures, and which may contain suitable ingredients, should be
used to counteract the effect of the impurity. Common soda will
answer the purpose perhaps better than anything else. It must not
be forgotten however that the blow-off apparatus must afterwards
be used more frequently, to rid the boiler of the foreign matter,
or the mischief will be increased. In marine boilers, constant
attention is necessary to get rid of the saline deposit; and in
stationary boilers using impure water an equally systematic attention

<p>Perhaps no cause of explosion is oftener mentioned than shortness
of water, and this is not unfrequently coupled with turning on the
feed suddenly into an overheated boiler. Many explosions have
been attributed to this cause, when closer investigation would have

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>

revealed some far more probable reason. For instance, shortness of
water was stated as the cause of the explosion, at Abercarn in 1865,
of a single-tube boiler with a very large flue tube, which collapsed
upwards from the bottom. The top of the tube and the sides of
the shell had not the slightest mark of overheating, although exposed
to the flame of three furnaces, one of which worked through the
tube, and the others on each side of the shell. In this case the
cause of explosion was clearly the weakness of the tube, and not
shortness of water. It is erroneous to suppose that if a boiler runs
dry, or if the feed is turned into a red-hot boiler, there must
necessarily be an explosion. If a boiler unconnected with any other
runs rapidly empty, from the breaking of the blow-off pipe or any
such cause, it will simply get red-hot and sink out of shape upon
the fire, as may often be seen, but no explosion would happen. If
the water only falls gradually, as it would if the feed were turned
off and evaporation continued, the parts exposed to the fire would
get overheated as the water left them. If the subsidence of the
water were very slow, those parts might get red-hot, and so much
softened and weakened as to be incapable of bearing the pressure,
when an explosion would take place, as at Smethwick, in the present
year, where the flues were set above the water line, as shown in
<a href="#fig74">Fig. 74</a>.</p>

<p>If however the water were turned on again before the overheating
had gone so far, and the feed pipe were, as usual, carried
down to nearly the bottom of the boiler, the water would gradually
creep up the heated sides and cool the plates, the heat of which
would not be sufficient to cause greater evaporation than the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>

ordinary safety valves would carry off. The danger would not
arise so much from the excess of steam generated by the heat
accumulated in the heated plates of the boiler, as from the injury
and strain that would be caused to the plates by the undue
expansion and sudden contraction, especially as this action would
take place on only a portion of the boiler. A singular case, bearing
on this point, may be mentioned. A four-furnace upright boiler,
like that shown in <a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>, happened to run so nearly empty,
through the accidental sticking of the self-acting feed apparatus,
that the level of the water sank to the top of the hemispherical
end forming the bottom of the boiler. The feed apparatus then
became released of itself, and, the feed being turned full on, the
water gradually rose until the whole occurrence was only discovered
by the leaking at the seams that had been sprung, which caused so
much steam in the flues as to stop the working of the furnaces.
The overheating had been sufficient to buckle the plates, and in one
place a rupture had almost commenced; but there was no explosion.
By way of direct experiment upon this point, boilers have been
purposely made red-hot and then filled with cold water, without
causing explosion.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig75">
   <img src="images/i_058.png" alt="upright boiler with bulged plate blown off" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 75.</div>
</div>

<p>It has been supposed that boilers sometimes explode from overheating
without the water level being below the usual point, or without the
accumulation of scurf previously alluded to, but simply by the rapidity
of the evaporation from an intensely heated surface causing such a
continuous current of steam as to prevent the proper contact of the
water with the heated plate. Such has been the cause assigned for the
explosion of a three-furnace upright boiler at Birmingham in 1865,
shown in <a href="#fig75">Fig. 75</a>. A piece of plate about 3 ft. by
1&frac12; ft. was blown out of the side, at a place where an enormous
flame impinged continually. The plates had first bulged out, and then
given way in the centre of the bulge, each edge being doubled back and
broken off. There was no positive evidence as to the water supply; but
the crown of the centre tube, which was much above the bottom of the
part blown out, remained uninjured.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig76">
   <img src="images/i_058b.png" alt="horizontal boiler with collapsed tube" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 76.</div>
</div>

<p>A somewhat similar case was that of a large horizontal boiler

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">Pg 57</a></span>

at Kidderminster, the tube of which collapsed in 1865, as shown in
<a href="#fig76">Fig. 76</a>. It was heated by four furnaces, one of which
worked into the tube, one under the bottom, and one on each side; and
all the furnaces worked into the same end of the boiler. The tube was
found to have partially collapsed at that end, and the top had dropped
11 inches. This was repaired in the first instance, but was afterwards
again found injured by overheating, although not so seriously. It is
very probable that the extremely rapid ebullition from the sides and
bottom, from which the steam had to pass up the narrow space between
the tube and the shell, produced such a foaming that very little solid
water could reach the top of the tube where it was exposed to extreme
heat.</p>

<p>Many explosions have been attributed to deterioration of the iron
through long use, as in an explosion at Durham in 1864, and another
at Haswell, near Sunderland, 1865, where the boilers had worked
constantly for 25 and 30 years respectively. When an explosion
arises from the failure of a plate which has not been properly welded
in rolling, there is no question that it was unsound when put in,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">Pg 58</a></span>

and escaped notice; but when the plate that fails is found to be
brittle and of bad iron, the fault is rather attributed to the effect
of working than to original bad quality. Of course this is not always
the case, as the injury done to plates by overheating has been already
explained. Pieces of plate have in some cases been erroneously
pronounced to be deteriorated by work, which have been taken from
situations in the boilers where they were not exposed to any action
of fire that could cause overheating; and therefore in reality the
injury could only have taken place when the boiler was being made, by
burning the iron in bending it to the required shape. A frequent cause
of fatal injury to boilers is injudicious repair, whereby the crossing
of the seams is destroyed, as in the explosion at Wolverhampton in
1865, previously referred to and shown in <a href="#fig36">Fig. 36</a>.
Moreover the edges of the old plates, already tried by the first
rivetting and the subsequent cutting out of the rivets, are frequently
strained again by the use of the drift to draw them up to the strong
new plates; and many a seam rip is thus started which ultimately causes
explosion.</p>

<p>Many explosions have been caused by the want of proper apparatus
for enabling the attendant to tell the height of the water and the
pressure of the steam, and also by the want of sufficient apparatus for
supply of feed water and escape of steam, or by the failure of one or
other of these; but such explosions can only be referred to generally
in the present paper. The mountings on a boiler are usually so open
to observation, and the importance of having them good and efficient
is so universally acknowledged, that much remark is not needed.
Mention has already been made of the sticking of self-acting feed
apparatus as a cause of mischief, and similar failures of floats and
gauges have constantly happened; but this should by no means be
considered to condemn self-acting apparatus, either for assisting in
the steadiness of working, or for giving warning of danger. The
apparatus however should be relied on for assistance only; and an
attendant cannot be called careful who leaves a boiler dependent on
such apparatus without watching. The self-acting principle has
been seen by the writer applied in a novel and useful way in a
recording pressure gauge, which proved the more interesting as it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span>

had shown the actual pressure of steam at the time of the explosion
of one of the boilers with which it was connected.</p>

<p>Among the numerous boiler explosions that have been attributed
to over-pressure through deficient arrangements for escape of steam,
in many cases the safety valves have been placed on the steam
pipes in such a manner that the communication with them was cut
off whenever the steam stop-valve was shut, which is just the time
when the safety valves are most wanted. Safety valves are too often
found needlessly overweighted; and it is believed that many boilers
are constantly worked with safety valves so imprudently arranged
and weighted, that they could not carry off all the steam the boilers
would generate without a very great increase of pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is concluded that enough has now been said to show that
boiler explosions do not arise from mysterious causes, but generally
from some defect which could have been remedied if it had been
known to exist. It only remains therefore to consider what is the
most ready and efficient way to discover the true condition of a
boiler. It has been maintained that this end is best accomplished
by what is called the hydraulic test, in which a pressure of water is
maintained in the boiler for a given time at a certain excess above
the working pressure. This test is undoubtedly useful so far as it
goes, and is perhaps the only one that can be applied to boilers with
small internal spaces, such as locomotive boilers, not admitting of
personal inspection over the whole of the interior; and it is also
admirable for testing the workmanship of a new boiler. But on the
other hand the conditions of a boiler at work are so different from
those which exist during the hydraulic test, that this alone cannot
be depended on; for old boilers have been known to stand this test
to double their working pressure without apparent injury, although
known to be dangerously corroded. The difficulty also of seeing or
measuring the effect of the hydraulic test upon large boilers set in
elaborate brickwork is so great that little practical benefit has
resulted in many cases.</p>

<p>It is believed by the writer that the surest way to ascertain the
true condition of a boiler is to examine it at frequent intervals in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">Pg 60</a></span>

every part, both inside and outside; and as this can only be done
when both the boilers and the flues can be readily entered, it is
specially important that facility for examination should be made a
consideration in selecting a construction of boiler. Permanent safety
should be considered as an element of economy, in addition to its
still higher importance in reference to the preservation of life.</p>

<p class="smcap">On the Conclusions Derived from the Experience of
Recent Steam Boiler Explosions, by Edward B. Marten, Mem. Inst. M.E.,
excerpt Minutes of Proceedings of the Meeting of the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, at Nottingham, 3rd August, 1870, Thomas Hawksley,
Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair. By permission of the Council.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p class="continued">The records of Steam Boiler Explosions in recent
years are very numerous, as the increased attention drawn to the
subject in this and other countries has placed far more information at
disposal; and the experience of the last four years, since a former
paper was read by the writer on the subject of boiler explosions, has
confirmed the opinion then expressed, that all boilers, however good in
original construction, are liable in the course of time to get into bad
order and explode. The particulars of the explosions during this period
are given in the Tables appended to the present paper, which show
the number of explosions due to each cause in each class of boiler,
distinguishing those of the United Kingdom from those in foreign
countries. An analysis is also given of the explosions in the last four
years, showing the causes of explosion of each form of boiler; and also
a summary of the causes of explosion under the three general heads
of&mdash;(1) faults in construction or repair: (2) faults in working
which creep on insidiously and unnoticed: (3) faults which might be
seen and guarded against by careful attendants. Nearly all of the
faults in these three classes would have been detected by periodical
examination.</p>

<p>In the case of Cornish, Lancashire, and other boilers with
internal flues, the faults of construction which have caused explosions
have been weakness in the tubes, combustion chambers, ends, domes,
or manholes; and explosions in these, as in other classes of boilers,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">Pg 62</a></span>

have also resulted from external or internal corrosion, shortness of
water, undue pressure of steam, and scale or mud on the boiler plates.</p>

<p>In plain cylindrical boilers, and others without internal flues,
explosions have resulted from the boiler ends being made flat, and
also from frequent repairs producing seam rips, especially in boilers
having the plates arranged lengthways instead of in rings.</p>

<p>In marine boilers, weak flues and weak ends have also led to
explosion, in addition to the other causes mentioned above.</p>

<p>Locomotive boilers have in two cases exploded in consequence of
the strains thrown upon them by their being used as a frame for
the engine.</p>

<p>Other explosions have resulted from want of stays, and from too
much heat impinging on some particular part; and in domestic
boilers from freezing of pipes under pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Altogether the total number of explosions in this country that
have been recorded during the past four years has amounted to 219,
which may be classed under the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although the importance of periodical examination as the best
safeguard against explosion is generally admitted, a great number of
those who make or use boilers have not at present sufficient belief
in its importance to adopt this course. Boilers are still constructed
or set in such a manner as to render examination next to impossible;
and are continued to be worked without making it the duty of those
who mind them, or of any one else, to examine every part at frequent
intervals; and hence such explosions have occurred as shown in
<a href="#fig1a">Fig. 1</a>, <a href="#no12-70">No. 12, 1870</a>, in which
the original position of the boiler before explosion is indicated by
the dotted lines.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span>

It is thought by many steam users that all has been done which is
possible, if their boilers are the best that can be procured, and
are set in the most approved way; and it is taken for granted that
such boilers should last for many years, under the idea that a good
boiler can never explode unless the feed is neglected. Similar
boilers are often referred to as having worked safely for ten or
twenty years, but it is forgotten that they may be exposed to the
insidious action of furrowing on the inside or channelling on the
outside, such as caused the explosions of the originally good boilers
shown in <a href="#fig2a">Fig. 2</a>, <a href="#fig3a">Fig. 3</a>,
<a href="#fig4a">Fig. 4</a>, and <a href="#fig5a">Fig. 5</a>,

<a href="#no46-69">No. 46, 1869</a>; and <a href="#no25-70">No. 25,

<p>Much mischief arises from special classes of boilers, fittings, or
apparatus, being looked upon as promising permanent safety from

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">Pg 65</a></span>

explosion; while the inevitable circumstance is overlooked that it is
only so long as everything is maintained in good condition that
safety is insured.</p>

<p class="continued">An apparatus, for instance, for preventing
explosion from shortness of water or over-pressure, however perfect
for any such object, would be quite inefficient as a safeguard
against explosion from corrosion, furrowing, channelling, or weak
construction. It is curious to note how often it is the case that every
other part of an establishment is subject to severe and perpetual
scrutiny, the engines especially being overhauled with the most
scrupulous regularity; while the boilers, the very source of the
power and the heart of the whole business, are left to themselves
for long periods, even for years, without examination; and it is too
often only after bitter experience that owners have understood the
need of this examination. In this, as in many other matters,
experience has shown that there is no royal road to safety, and
that immunity is only secured by unremitting care and constant
watchfulness. It should never be forgotten that even a good boiler
can explode; for however good at the outset, sooner or later the
time must eventually arrive, when such wear and tear will have
taken place as will result in dangerous weakness, unless the boiler is
carefully and systematically attended to. Although a boiler may
even last safely for ten to thirty or more years if worked slowly and
with care, no confidence can be placed in a boiler which has worked
so long, unless it is examined in every part.</p>

<p>The opinion is more general than many are aware of, that explosions
as a rule are caused by shortness of water and the sudden turning
on of the feed water upon red-hot plates; and the appearances of
injury in the plates from fire, arising in the ordinary course of
working, have been frequently mistaken for signs of overheating
from shortness of water at the time of explosion, as illustrated
in <a href="#fig6a">Fig. 6</a> and <a href="#fig7a">Fig. 7</a>,
<a href="#no24-67">No. 24, 1867</a>, and <a href="#no59-66">No. 59,
1866</a>. Although boilers do explode from the softening of the plates
by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">Pg 67</a></span>

overheating in consequence of shortness of water, yet it is very
doubtful whether the turning on of the cold water at such a time is
ever the cause of explosion. The feed water being always introduced
at the bottom of the boiler, as in <a href="#fig8a">Fig. 8</a>,
<a href="#fig9a">Fig. 9</a>, and <a href="#fig10a">Fig. 10</a>, cannot be
scattered suddenly near the overheated parts, but must rise gradually
up the sides; and the boiler would have gone to pieces from the giving
way of the softened parts long before the water reached them, as was
the case in the explosions shown in <a href="#fig11a">Fig. 11</a> and
<a href="#fig12a">Fig. 12</a>, end of 1868. The experiment of injecting
cold water into red-hot boilers has been carefully tried more than
once, without producing any explosion.</p>

<p>Although it may be too much to suppose that boiler explosions
will ever be entirely prevented, it is important that those who have

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>

the care of boilers should understand better what are the true
causes of explosion, in order that they may know what to guard
against in addition to shortness of water. This better understanding
of the subject has been much retarded by the supposition that the
causes of boiler explosions are beyond the comprehension of the boiler
minders; and still more by the important differences of opinion
among those under whom they work. Much evil has resulted from
the promulgation of strongly expressed views, which have been
founded upon facts but of too limited extent, and such as must
become modified by consideration of the facts of a large number and
variety of explosions. Mysterious theories to account for explosions
have been resorted to only from want of clearer explanations.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig13a">

   <img src="images/i_070b.png" alt="boiler flattened by explosion" />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 14.</div>
</div>

<p>Before considering in detail the causes of explosion, it is
necessary to recall to mind that beyond question there is sufficient
accumulated force in any working boiler to cause all the violent
effects of an explosion, if this force be suddenly liberated. In
<a href="#fig13a">Fig. 13</a> and <a href="#fig14a">Fig. 14</a>,
<a href="#no18-69">No. 18, 1869</a>, and <a href="#no63-66">No. 63,
1866</a>, are shown the violent effects of the rupture of vessels
employed for steaming rags, which were filled with steam only.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>

In ordinary boilers however there is present, besides the steam, a
quantity of water heated much beyond the atmospheric boiling point;
and when rupture takes place and the pressure is suddenly relieved,
part of this water evaporates, and keeps up the supply of steam to
continue the rupture and destruction. The explosion of a boiler differs
from the discharge of electricity or lightning, which cleaves the air
and instantly leaves a vacuum; it also differs from the discharge of
detonating compounds which act suddenly and leave a vacuum; but it more
nearly resembles the discharge of gunpowder, which burns sufficiently
slowly to keep up a continuous pressure behind a projectile until it
leaves a gun; and each cubic foot of water in a boiler working at 60
lbs. pressure has been shown to produce in steam an explosive effect
equal to one pound of gunpowder. None of the elaborate but unlikely
theories of decomposed steam, or of electric accumulations, suppose a
force

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">Pg 70</a></span>

so fitted to cause destruction as that contained in the highly heated
water existing in all working boilers.</p>

<p>First as to faults of construction which fall under the department
of the boiler maker or repairer. One of the most apparent causes of
explosion in stationery boilers is the loss of strength occasioned by
frequent repair, not only from the injury done to the old plates by
removing rivets, but from the want of bond in the new work. This has
lead to many of the explosions of the Plain Cylindrical boilers, such
as are shown in <a href="#fig15a">Fig. 15</a>, <a href="#fig16a">Fig.
16</a>, and <a href="#fig17a">Fig. 17</a>, <a href="#no45-69">No.
45, 1869</a>, <a href="#no32-70">No. 32, 1870</a>, and
<a href="#no20-70">No. 20, 1870</a>. Where the plates are arranged

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span>

longitudinally instead of in rings, the danger is increased, as there
is less chance of a dangerous rip being arrested by a crossed joint.
So great a number of boilers with continuous longitudinal seams,
especially in the North, have worked for twenty or thirty years,
that it can hardly be supposed they are any weaker than the boilers
made in rings; but they are more liable to explode, for if a seam
rip occurs, it more easily extends along the seam, and leads to the
general break up of the boiler, shown in <a href="#fig18a">Fig. 18</a>,
<a href="#no59-69">No. 59, 1869</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps no boilers have worked for a greater number of years
than the Plain Cylindrical boilers, many specimens being in existence
and apparently in good order which were put to work fifty or sixty
years ago. When such boilers have been too much or injudiciously

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">Pg 72</a></span>

repaired, they are treacherous and uncertain; but their rupture and
explosion occur not so much on account of fault of shape, as
from the simple reason that like willing horses they are easily
overworked. The grates are usually twice as large as the fair
proportion to the heating surface, producing the double evil of
forcing more heat through the iron plates over the fire than they can
transmit without injury, and allowing a great amount of heat to pass
away to the chimney without useful effect. Careful experiment
shows that nearly as good duty can be obtained with the plain
cylindrical boiler as with any other form, provided the rate of
combustion is in fair proportion to the extent of heating surface in
the boiler. The circumstance that many plain cylindrical boilers have
exploded is not sufficient to condemn this make of boiler, which is
the cheapest, simplest, and most easily set. If the number of
explosions alone were to be taken as the guide, it would lead to the
condemnation of the Cornish and Lancashire boilers, from the
experience of the past four years. But in case of both plain
cylindrical and other forms of boilers, most of the dangers admit of
remedy, and can be guarded against by frequent examination.</p>

</div>

<p>Five very fatal explosions have occurred of boilers heated by
Puddling and Mill Furnaces, leading in some cases to the supposition
that this form of boiler is more liable to explosion than others.
They were not adopted however in the iron-making districts without
great care and consideration, and there does not seem ground for
attributing special danger to them. The causes of the five explosions
referred to of these boilers were manifest, and would have led to
the explosion of any form of boiler; the loss of life however was
great, because the situation of the boilers was among a large number
of workmen. The steam power required in ironworks so far exceeds that
in any other trade, that an ironwork is half composed of boilers; the
workmen are necessarily within the range of explosion of many boilers,
and hence the great loss of life when such an accident occurs. The
explosions of such boilers shown in <a href="#fig19a">Fig. 19</a> and
<a href="#fig20a">Fig. 20</a>, <a href="#no24-68">No. 24, 1868</a>, and
<a href="#no31-68">No. 31, 1868</a>, were from external and internal
corrosion respectively of the bottoms, rendering them too weak to bear
the ordinary pressure.</p>

</div>

<p>The greatest number of explosions and the greatest loss of life
and personal injury have been in the case of Cornish and Lancashire
boilers, or others with internal flues. In the county of Cornwall
itself there have been many explosions, as often from the rupture of
the shell, <a href="#fig23a">Fig. 23</a>, <a href="#no58-69">No. 58,
1869</a>, as from the collapse of the tube, <a href="#fig25a">Fig.
25</a>, <a href="#no35-69">No. 35, 1869</a>. The temporary patching on
some of these old boilers was most extensive, <a href="#fig26a">Fig.
26</a>, <a href="#no52-69">No. 52, 1869</a>, and the only wonder really
was that they held together as long as they did. The belief that
shortness of water is the only cause which can lead to the collapse of
tubes is so strong, that the boiler minders have often been condemned
almost unheard in cases of explosion, as if there were no room for
doubt that their neglect was the cause. Explosions from weakness of
tubes are not however confined to Cornwall,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span>

as for example in <a href="#fig27a">Fig. 27</a>, <a href="#no42-68">No.
42, 1868</a>, where the flue was oval and very weak: although it was
supposed that shortness of water caused the accident, from the idea
that nothing else could account for it. The strain caused by the
varying temperature of the internal tubes in Cornish or Lancashire
boilers, and the difficulty of staying their flat ends so as to make
them sufficiently secure without being too rigid to allow for the
expansion of the tubes, render them liable to corrosion or "furrowing"
in particular lines of strain, the destructive action of which is
very rapid; while the large quantity of brickwork around the outside,
necessary to form the external flues, also renders them liable to
corrosion in the parts most difficult of access. In this favourite

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">Pg 77</a></span>

form of boiler therefore careful and frequent examination in every part
is more needed than in boilers of simpler form and setting; and the
increasing number of explosions among these boilers seems to establish
that they are only trustworthy if frequently examined and kept in
perfect order.</p>

<p>Several instances have occurred of explosion of Portable Crane
Boilers. Their small size has led to their condition being disregarded,
under the idea that scarcely any pressure could burst them. In practice
it is found however that they are often exposed to greater pressure
than other boilers, because the fire is large and quick in proportion
to their size; and they often have to stand for a considerable time
with the steam up, and their exposed position and long intervals of
rest add to the chances of corrosion, as shown by the example in
<a href="#fig28a">Fig. 28</a>, <a href="#no14-69">No. 14, 1869</a>. The
large manholes without strengthening rings, that are so often put in
these boilers, have been the cause of explosions such as that shown in
<a href="#fig29a">Fig. 29</a>, <a href="#no57-66">No. 57, 1866</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The same remark applies to some of the portable or agricultural

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">Pg 78</a></span>

boilers which have exploded, such as those shown in
<a href="#fig30a">Fig. 30</a> and <a href="#fig31a">Fig. 31</a>,
<a href="#no43-68">No. 43, 1868</a>, and <a href="#no12-69">No. 12,

   <div class="caption">Fig. 37.</div>
</div>

<p>Much mischief is often caused by bad imitation of well planned
boilers. Thus in boilers of the Cornish form, the ends are made
sometimes so rigid as to give no allowance for the expansion of the
tube, and the result is such continued strain as to cause constant
leaking and the consequent risk of fracture. In furnace boilers
the tops of the crowns of the inside tubes are often made flat, as
in <a href="#fig37a">Fig. 37</a>, instead of being domed; or the
inside tube is of undue size, as in <a href="#fig21a">Fig. 21</a>,
<a href="#no23-70">No. 23, 1870</a>, see page 73. Furnace boilers
have been made with the omission of the stays that are so peculiarly
necessary in that form, whereby both ends have been left free to bulge
outwards with the pressure, as in <a href="#fig32a">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Cornish boilers are often altered to the plain cylindrical form,
without compensation being made for the loss of strength caused by
the removal of the tube; this has led to such explosions as shown in
<a href="#fig33a">Fig. 33</a>, <a href="#no47-69">No. 47, 1869</a>,
where two tubes where taken out, and <a href="#fig34a">Fig. 34</a>,
<a href="#no42-67">No. 42, 1867</a>, where one tube was taken out.
One of the most frequent and serious causes of loss of strength
is the repairing of externally fired boilers. Not only are the
patches sometimes only bolted on in a temporary manner, as in
<a href="#fig35a">Fig. 35</a>, <a href="#no29-69">No. 29, 1869</a>, but
even where they are rivetted on there is an entire want of bond or
crossed joint, as in the case of the exploded boilers shown in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">Pg 80</a></span>

<p>An attempt is made in <a href="#fig38a">Fig. 38</a> to show the
effect of wear and tear of boiler plate in an ordinary upright furnace
boiler, such as is shown in <a href="#fig37a">Fig. 37</a>. The external
surface is exposed to intense heat and consequently expands, while the
internal surface is kept cool by contact with the water and expands to
a much less degree. The continued repetition of this process produces
the same effect of cracking the surface as that seen in the anvil
blocks of steam hammers; and the strength of the plate is reduced in
proportion to the destruction of the continuity of its surface. The
deleterious effect of this process is much increased if the boiler is
subject to alternate

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">Pg 81</a></span>

heating and streams of cold air on opening the fire-doors. To avoid
it the flame should have room to spread over as large a surface as
possible, without impinging on one particular point, and the firing
should be as regular as possible; and hence the greater freedom from
injury in boilers mechanically fired or heated by gas. The above action
is quite distinct from the overheating of the plates that occurs when
no water is in contact with them, which simply softens them and reduces
their strength, as in <a href="#fig39a">Fig. 39</a>. It is believed
that many boilers suffer from overheating without being short of
water: and an attempt is made to show this action in such an upright
boiler as is represented in <a href="#fig37a">Fig. 37</a>, page 78,
by the enlarged section of the side shown in <a href="#fig40a">Fig.
40</a>. The flame is shown impinging on a limited surface, as before,
and the steam rises so rapidly from the inner surface as to maintain
a continuous stratum of steam between the iron and the water, and the
plate consequently becomes overheated at that part. When the intense
flame subsides by an alteration of the working of the furnace, the
stream of steam diminishes, and the water returns and suddenly cools
and contracts the plate, but often not before it has commenced to
get out of shape. This has perhaps led to the explosion shown in
<a href="#fig59a">Fig. 59</a>, <a href="#no37-68">No. 37, 1868</a>,
page 82. The same thing may happen to the crowns of tubes of internally
fired boilers when over fired, as in <a href="#fig41a">Fig. 41</a>.
Success has attended the use of internal linings to boilers, arranged
so as to ensure a rapid circulation over the most heated parts, and
also to catch all the mud and loose scale.</p>

<p>In order to enable boiler minders to make proper periodical
examinations, it is necessary that care should be taken to arrange both
the boilers and the flues with that view; and this can be done without
materially injuring the efficiency of the boiler. Ordinary plain
cylindrical boilers can be entered easily, as in <a href="#fig42a">Fig.
42</a>; and although the small spaces between the tubes and the shells
of Cornish and Lancashire Boilers, as shown in <a href="#fig43a">Fig.
43</a>, render the complete examination troublesome, there is no
difficulty in seeing those parts most likely to need examination, such
as the crowns of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">Pg 83</a></span>

the tubes and the end plates and angle iron. It is in the external
flues that greater accommodation is needed, as in many cases these
are so narrow that the boiler is quite inaccessible without pulling
down the brickwork, as in <a href="#fig44a">Fig. 44</a> and
<a href="#fig45a">Fig. 45</a>. The loss of heating effect caused by
the use of wider flues is so little, that it is far outweighed by the
greater security obtained from the more efficient examination that
is thereby rendered practicable. The flues of the plain cylindrical
boiler are easily made wide enough for a man to pass through them.
The flues of Cornish and Lancashire boilers should be made as shown
in <a href="#fig46a">Fig. 46</a> and <a href="#fig47a">Fig. 47</a>,
so that a man can enter them without such inconvenience as in
<a href="#fig48a">Fig. 48</a>. One point of danger being the use of
wide mid-feather walls, on which corrosion is apt to take place,
these should be narrowed and the weight of the boiler supported on
side brackets; the top of the mid-feather and side walls can then
be constructed with sight holes as at <strong>A A</strong> in <a
href="#fig49a">Fig. 49</a> and <a href="#fig50a">Fig. 50</a>, so as
to give the means of examining the plates near each seam by simply
removing loose bricks.</p>

<p>The explosions of fourteen Domestic or Heating-Apparatus Boilers are
included in the list of explosions, <a href="#table_iii">Table III</a>; and some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">Pg 84</a></span>

notice is required to be taken of these, because they have led to the
loss of the lives of those who could not be expected to know their
construction or how to guard against accident; and as these boilers
are seldom seen or examined after they are once set, they should be
the more carefully constructed. In one or two cases these boilers
were of a rectangular shape, as in <a href="#fig51a">Fig. 51</a>,
<a href="#no41-68">No. 41, 1868</a>, ill adapted to bear internal
pressure, and yet placed in connection with cisterns in the roofs of
lofty houses, so as to expose them to a hydrostatic pressure almost up
to their bursting strength without any addition of steam pressure. The
most usual cause of explosion is the lighting of the fire during frosty
weather in a house that has been left vacant, so that steam pressure
accumulates in the boiler whilst the exit is frozen up, as was the case
in <a href="#fig52a">Fig. 52</a>, <a href="#no6-70">No. 6, 1870</a>.</p>

<p>The cast-iron boilers commonly used, <a href="#fig53a">Fig. 53</a>,
end of 1869, are capable of bearing but little pressure; and the
wrought iron boilers,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">Pg 85</a></span>

as in <a href="#fig54a">Fig. 54</a>, <a href="#no7-70">No. 7, 1870</a>,
are found often so badly welded as to be but little stronger; but even
if they were as strong as they could be made, the stoppage of the pipes
by ice would lead to explosion. Steam pressure may be guarded against
by a safety valve; but as this may become set fast in a little time, it
would be far better to avoid all chance of steam accumulation by such
an arrangement as that shown in <a href="#fig55a">Fig. 55</a>, where
the circulating boiler is placed within an open-topped boiler behind
the kitchen fire, and only receives its heat through the hot water
surrounding it, and therefore cannot itself become sufficiently hot to
generate steam.</p>

<p>A few remarks may be useful as to those faults arising in working
which fall under the department of the boiler minders. Not a few of
the explosions during the last four years have occurred from acts of
simple carelessness, such as where a blow-off pipe was left open,
so that the boiler was nearly emptied of water while at work; or in
another case where two boilers were fed at the same time through a
common pipe without a back valve, and the water from one "kicked" over
into the other. Undue pressure has been allowed to accumulate by safety
valves being tied down, as in the agricultural boiler,
<a href="#fig56a">Fig. 56</a>, <a href="#no16-67">No. 16, 1867</a>; or
by an extra weight being put upon the safety valve, as in an instance
where three bricks were fastened to the lever and the fires were
lighted earlier than usual, under the idea that an accumulation of
steam could be raised during the night to make a good start in the
morning. Another explosion was caused by working a boiler at more than
three times its proper pressure to meet a temporary emergency. In not a
few

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">Pg 86</a></span>

cases of explosion there was no pressure gauge on the boiler, or
the gauge was out of repair in consequence of being placed on the
steam pipe, so that it vibrated with every stroke of the engine;
as in the examples shown in <a href="#fig24a">Figs. 24</a> and
<a href="#fig16a">Fig. 16</a>, <a href="#no35-68">No. 35, 1868</a>,
<a href="#no32-70">No. 32, 1870</a>, pages 70 and 74.</p>

   <div class="caption">Fig. 57.</div>
</div>

<p>Corrosion has been the direct cause of many of the explosions. In
one or two cases the corrosion was known to exist, but the renewal
of the boiler was too long delayed, as in <a href="#fig57a">Fig.
57</a>, <a href="#no8-69">No. 8, 1869</a>, in others it took both
owners and minders by surprise, as in <a href="#fig1a">Fig. 1</a>, <a
href="#no12-70">No. 12, 1870</a>, page 63. It is said that to produce
rapid rusting of iron there must be present oxygen, water, and carbonic
acid; and as all these are present in a boiler flue when there are
leaks, it is not surprising that so many cases occur of explosions from
corrosion.</p>

<p>Much mischief is often done by the injudicious use of compositions
in the boiler that are designed to prevent incrustation, especially
where there is no blow-off cock or where its use is neglected. A hard
deposit on the boiler plates is, in the writer's opinion, not so
injurious as the soft and muddy deposit produced by the use of such
compositions. A hard scale is equivalent to thickening the plate; and
although this is sufficiently mischievous, the injury to the plates is
much more rapid when a thicker but spongy deposit entirely prevents
contact of the water and impedes the transmission of the heat. An
attempt to illustrate this is given in <a href="#fig58a">Fig. 58</a>,
which is an enlarged view of a portion of such a boiler as is shown in
<a href="#fig37a">Fig. 37</a>.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">Pg 87</a></span>

The money spent in boiler compositions would be better applied in
securing a supply of proper water, or in filtering and purifying the
water before it enters the boiler.</p>

<p>The writer has had to mention only faults in boilers; but it is not
to be inferred that all boilers are working in actual danger. A very
small percentage perhaps are so; but without periodical examination
no one can feel sure of the condition of any boiler. It is not likely
that explosions in future will be from exactly the same causes as those
now described, because the known faults will be avoided. For instance
no new Balloon, Wagon, or Butterley boilers are now made; and the
peculiar faults and the weakness of the tubes in Cornish and others of
the better classes of boilers are now so well known as to be generally
avoided; and as information spreads, many evils will become things of
the past.</p>

<p>As periodical examination has been so strongly advocated, it might
seem natural to desire that it should be enforced by government
authority; but this is by no means recommended. A select parliamentary
committee has been recently investigating the subject, with a view to
ascertain whether that would be desirable, but has adjourned for the
session without coming to any decision on this point. Even if a perfect
system of government inspection could be contrived and perfectly
administered, it would have the effect of taking the responsibility
from the owners, who are the natural guardians of the safety of their
boilers. Although the loss of 70 lives per annum by boiler explosions
is sufficiently deplorable, the deaths by railway accidents are more
than three times that number; yet

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">Pg 88</a></span>

very little inspection of railways is held to be necessary, and that
inspection takes place chiefly before the commencement of working or
after accidents. A coercive system may introduce more evils than it
cures, especially as at present so much difference of opinion exists
respecting the causes of boiler explosions. In the opinion of the
writer, far more real good arises from the calm discussion of the
facts and from the spread of correct information by such societies
as this Institution, than from enforcing by law any action which is
not perhaps believed by the majority of steam users to be at all
necessary or useful. It has been at times suggested to increase the
power and responsibility of coroners in holding inquests upon those
killed by boiler explosions, by requiring them to obtain scientific
evidence and to insist that the causes of the explosions shall be
added to the verdicts of juries. But it is believed that this would
only encumber an important institution, because a jury who might well
decide whether a person had been killed by any criminal carelessness
would not be a suitable tribunal to decide between possibly conflicting
scientific evidence; and also, as an inquest may result in a verdict
of manslaughter, the eliciting of information on such an occasion is
checked by the natural fear of inadvertently involving some one in so
serious a charge. The public at large, and steam users generally, would
gain more information and guidance from the scientific evidence itself
than from the verdict of a coroner's jury; and it is believed much good
has resulted in preventing locomotive boiler explosions by publishing
the reports of the government inspecting engineers, who have gained
their knowledge of the facts in conversation with all those concerned,
and have added recommendations which have been promptly acted upon.</p>

<p>The writer's object has been that the boilers found most convenient
and best suited for the different purposes for which they are used
should be made to work with safety, rather than that reliance should be
placed upon the qualities of any particular kind of boiler or fittings.
No form of boiler at present admits of absolute reliance upon its
freedom from risk.</p>

<p>The following general conclusions appear to arise from the
consideration of the records of boiler explosions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">Pg 89</a></span></p>

<ol>
   <li>That the force accumulated in an ordinary boiler is enough to
   account for the violence of an explosion.</li>

   <li>That no form of boiler, however well constructed and
   fitted, is free from the liability to explosion, if allowed to
   get out of order; and that boilers which bear the hydraulic
   test may still be dangerous.</li>

   <li>That the condition of a boiler can be satisfactorily ascertained
   only by periodical examinations, and that no boiler should work
   without being thoroughly examined at short intervals.</li>

   <li>That the cost of periodical examination is so little as to be far
   outweighed by the greater security obtained; and that the settings
   of all boilers should be constructed with a view to facilitate
   examination.</li>

   <li>That the surest way to make systematic examination general
   is to spread as widely as possible correct information as to the facts
   and ascertained causes of boiler explosions, and to inform boiler
   owners and minders what dangers to guard against; and that this
   is preferable, and more likely to lessen explosions than enforcing
   any system of inspection by legal enactment.</li>

<p>Locomotive, 110 lbs., standing with steam up near a platform.
All but the fire box was blown away, the main portion being thrown
a distance of 400 yards. The first rent took place at a longitudinal
seam of the barrel where grooving had gone on very rapidly, which
was not discovered when examined and tested a short time before.</p>

<p>Butterley, 26ft. 6in. long, and 9ft. diameter. The wagon-shaped

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1866002">Pg '66-2</a></span>

top to the fire place was 8ft. 6in. long, and was attached to the
bell-mouth of the internal tube, which then continued circular to the
back of the boiler. The tube was 3ft. 6in. diameter. All the plates
were about 7-16ths inch thick, and although the boiler was an old one,
they were nowhere reduced in thickness by wear. The usual pressure of
steam was 18 lbs., and a self-registering gauge showed that at the time
of explosion it did not exceed 20 lbs.</p>

<p>The top of the fire grate on the right side rent longitudinally,
and the upper part of the shell consisting of four rings of plates,
and also the top of the fire place opened out and blew away to a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>The front end also blew away. The bell-mouth of the tube was blown
to the front, and the tube which remained in the back part of the shell
collapsed upwards.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion was most likely the intrinsic weakness
of boilers of this shape, especially over the fire, where the top is
only retained in its shape by numerous stays. The boiler had been very
frequently repaired, at this the weakest place, and its strength had
been thus so reduced as to make it unable to bear even a few pounds
more than the ordinary working pressure.</p>

<p>The whistle was found to have been gagged by hemp, carefully
inserted, so that there is ground for supposing there had been
intentional unfair usage.</p>

return flue, 14 lbs. There were altogether three rents in the tube
over the fire, as a small band was held in its place by a stay from
the tube to the shell. The escaping contents scalded those near, but
no damage was done to anything but the boiler.</p>

<p>The cause was stated to be shortness of water. There was
no water gauge.</p>

<p>About 8ft of the back portion of the shell was torn off, leaving
the tubes and ends intact.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion was considered to be excessive pressure,
but how accumulated did not transpire.</p>

<p>It is most natural to expect that there must have been corrosion
under the bottom to cause the first rent.</p>

<p>Agricultural, 8ft. 2in. long, 3ft. 6in. diameter in the barrel,
5-16ths inch plates, internal fire box, 2ft. 4in. wide, 2ft. 4in. high,
and 2ft. 10in. deep. From the back of this fire box, two 12-inch tubes
passed to an internal chamber at the back of the barrel. From this
again passed nine 3&frac34; inch tubes to an exterior smoke-box fixed
over the fire door. The boiler was fitted with one spring safety valve,
which was screwed down tight, but there was no pressure gauge. The
front plate was intended to be bolted on so that the fire-box and tubes
could be taken out for cleaning, but it had been rivetted, leaving no
means of cleaning, and it was nearly full of scurf.</p>

<p>The crown plate of fire-box which was too flat and unstrengthened,
rent at the front and along both top edges, and was driven into the
fire. The boiler was thrown backwards and reared against a wall,
resting on the front right hand corner.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion was that the very dirty state, caused
overheating where the water was not in proper contact with the plates,
and the defective construction did not admit of proper cleaning. The
mountings were insufficient for the proper protection of the boiler.</p>

<p>Plain Cylinder Boiler with hemispherical ends, 30ft. long and 6ft.
diameter, 3/8 inch plates, 30 lbs. It was the second from the engine
in a bed of five, and had been at work three years, then remained
idle for eight years, working again fourteen years. The boiler was
mounted with two safety valves 3-7/8 and 4 inches diameter, a float
and alarm whistle. The boiler had been more than once repaired
over the fire with several new plates. One seam over the fire had
been observed to leak about a week before the explosion, but not
seriously, and had been caulked. The boiler had just been started
after cleaning. Six months before explosion, the boiler had been
tested to 69 lbs.</p>

<p>About 5 feet of the front end of the boiler opened out flat, and
was thrown to the rear about 60 yards; the front hemispherical end
was liberated and thrown 20 yards also to the rear and right hand.
The back part of the boiler was thrown in a mass, and after
bounding twice, lodged at a distance of 230 yards.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion appeared to be from the failure of a
seam over the fire place in a plate deteriorated by age, and overheated
through a deposit of scurf and mud.</p>

<p>Plain Cylindrical Boiler, with hemispherical ends, 23ft. long, and
5ft. diameter, 3/8 inch plates, 50 lbs. It was set so as to be fired
under the bottom if required, but the grate was seldom used. The
principal heat was supplied from a mill furnace, the neck of which
was at the left hand of the back, and the flame was carried by a
wheel flue round the front of the boiler to the stack on the right
hand side of the back. The boiler was fitted with a 4&frac34;-inch safety
valve, and also a float, but it was suspected that the latter had
broken from the rod.</p>

<p>A horizontal seam about the middle of the left hand side had
given way, and the upper portion of the 3rd and 4th rings of plates
had spread out like a lid without being detached from the boiler.
The front end became detached and was thrown some distance to
the front.</p>

<p>The cause of explosion was, that the left side of the boiler became
overheated, and so much softened, that it first bulged outwards with
the ordinary working pressure, and then rent open. The overheating
was most likely the result of shortness of water, but it might possibly
have been in consequence of the intense heat of a mill furnace
impinging on a small area so near the water line, leading to such
rapid ebullition as to prevent sufficient contact of the water to keep
the plates cool.</p>

<p>Plain Cylinder Boiler, 36ft. long, 5ft. 6in. diameter, 60 lbs.
It had frequently been repaired over the fire, so that the longitudinal
seams ran for several plates without break of joint. A patch
had been put on a few days before explosion, and as the rivet holes
had badly fitted, there had been much strain caused by drifting,
and the rivets were much distorted.</p>

<p>A longitudinal seam gave way over the fire, when two rings of
plates opened out, rending the transverse seams at each side until
completely separated, and fell in two parts at a distance of about
100 yards in front of the boiler. The front end was liberated and
fell in one piece about 100 yards beyond the two pieces of the shell.
The main body of the boiler was driven back a few yards and
rolled over so as to be upside down, but was little injured.</p>

<p>The frequent and badly executed repair over the fireplace, had
so weakened the structure as to make it unable to bear the very
high ordinary pressure. This frequent repair over the fireplace
had been made necessary by very hard firing and deposits of scurf
from muddy water, preventing the proper contact of the water with
the plates.</p>

back end, with the collapsed tube within it, were driven back against
another wall, about the same distance away. Very great damage was done
to the surrounding property.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion was the weakness of the tube of so large
a diameter, without strengthening rings, which made it unable to bear
the ordinary working pressure. It is very probable, however, that at
the time of the explosion, the pressure was considerably more than
usual during the stoppage of the engine, and the confusion caused by a
man becoming entangled in the machinery.</p>

sufficient steam generated to drive the water from it into the other

<p>Rag Boiler, not used for the generation of steam. It was a plain
cylinder, with hemispherical ends, about 16ft. long, and 7ft. diameter.
There was a neck at each end upon which the boiler revolved, and
through one of these the steam was admitted to a pressure of 30 lbs.,
in order to assist in cleaning the rags. There was a large manhole for
filling and emptying.</p>

<p>The boiler rent in the middle, and each half was blown to some
distance.</p>

<p>The manhole was so large, that the strength of the boiler was too
much reduced, and the constant strain of revolving caused a central
seam to give way at the ordinary pressure.</p>

diameter, 3/8 inch plates, 100 lbs. It was double-rivetted, and the
crown of tube was strengthened with angle iron. The shell was formed
of six rings, each of two plates alternately jointed top and sides.
The third ring from the front had stripped off, and was thrown to the
right and forwards against a wall. The line of rent was confined to the
plates forming the ring, which was an outer one, and covered the two
adjoining rings in the laps, the rent being from the edge of the inner
lap to the nearest rivets. The first rent had taken place in the solid
iron, about 1 inch from the rivets of a seam on one side, and from this
the rent had extended along the seams on either side, and of course
the whole ring soon tore off when the equilibrium was destroyed by the
first rent.</p>

<p>The fittings of the boiler were sufficient, except that there was
only one safety valve, and that was so constructed that it could only
open a very little way.</p>

<p>The cause was a defect in the iron at the point of the first rent,
and accumulated pressure during the time of standing.</p>

internal fireplaces, of irregular shape, uniting at the back into one
flue of similar shape, which did not come to the front, but passed
through the steam space, and out at the top of the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1866025">Pg '66-25</a></span></p>

<p>While the vessel was waiting to start, with steam up, the wing
furnace of the starboard boiler collapsed on the wing side, as shown
by the dotted lines, and allowed the steam and water to escape into
the stoke hole.</p>

<p>The side of the furnace next the shell was rent along the edge of
a longitudinal seam in a line, which was slightly nicked in the
caulking. This rent extended about 5ft. 6in. from the front, and
then at a cross seam it went along the line of rivets from the crown
to the bottom of the furnace. Beyond this cross seam the furnace
was collapsed, until it nearly touched the other side of the furnace,
and the bulge died away towards the back end. There was also a
rent in the lower part of the front of the shell, as shown in
dotted line.</p>

<p>The cause of the explosion was the weakness of the shape of the
flue, which was not stayed to the shell. It had evidently gradually
been giving way some time before the explosion, and eventually
collapsed at nearly the ordinary pressure. Symptoms of the same
alteration of shape were noticed in the corresponding flue of the
other boiler.</p>

<p>The outer shell of the boiler was rent into many pieces, leaving
the central conical fireplace intact. The nature of the rents showed
that the plate round the manhole, which was unstrengthened by a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1866026">Pg '66-26</a></span>

ring, had first given way, and all the other fractures had led away
from that point. This is confirmed by the fact, that the manlid
was thrown a good distance, with force enough to make its way
through the timber walls of a cabin. The front plate divided into
many pieces, and scattered right and left, while the back plate was
thrown through a cabin in the opposite direction to the manhole.</p>

<p>The central flue showed a slight indication of overheating, but
the construction was such that the upper portion passed through the
steam space, and was always exposed to the action of the fire,
without the protection of the contact of water. The manhole
without a ring on its edge to strengthen the plate, and held in by
two clamps, which caused additional strain when carelessly screwed
up, was by far the weakest place. The engine was standing after
a short time of working, and as the safety valve was very defective,
and could be screwed down until tight, against almost any pressure,
it is most probable that the pressure mounted much higher than
usual, when the weakest part gave way, and led to the sudden
tearing up and scattering of the whole fabric.</p>

<p>Faulty construction of both boiler and fittings, rendered it unable
to bear that accumulated pressure, which the safety valve ought to
have made impossible.</p>

<p>Two Marine Boilers exploded simultaneously. They were 16ft. long,
6ft. 6in. diameter at the flat front ends, and somewhat less at the
hemispherical back ends. Each had two internal fireplaces, united in
one flue, which returned nearly to the front and passed up through the
steam space, and out at the top of shell into the funnel. The central
fireplaces were not circular, and the outside fireplaces and the return
flues were still more distorted, but the weakness of the shape was
somewhat compensated for by stays between the tubes, and from the tubes
to the shell. The mountings to the boiler were of the ordinary kind and
efficient.</p>

<p>The under sides of the shells were so deeply corroded that they
were rent longitudinally for their whole length, allowing the sides
to open out and tear away from the front ends. Each shell fell at a
considerable distance. The furnaces, with parts of the front ends
attached, fell into the water, but except one of the side flues that
was a little collapsed, they were uninjured. Small pieces of the front
ends were thrown to a great distance. The sides of the vessel were so
completely blown out that she sank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1866028">Pg '66-28</a></span></p>

the boiler appeared to have turned over. Part of the fire-box was sent
through the stage upon which the boiler was travelling, and the barrel
with the tubes remaining in it, first struck a rail which caused it to
be dented in, and then rebounded to a point about 100 yards from its
original position.</p>

<p>Enough of the fragments were not recovered from the river to trace
the cause of the explosion, but it is presumed that, although when the
boiler was left, only 20 lbs. pressure was shown by the gauge; the fire
door being left closed, the pressure must have risen to a point much
above the working pressure, and to more than the boiler could bear.</p>

<p>The dome was split in two, in the line marked in the sketch, owing
to the extreme weakness of the shell at the juncture of the dome, and
the shell was a little ruptured on each side of it, and so large a rent

<p>The manhole was large, to facilitate filling and emptying, and was
rectangular and unstrengthened on the edges, and measured 3ft. 6in. in
length, and 1ft. 6in. in width, and the lid fitted on the inside and
was held by clamps.</p>

<p>The boiler was much out of repair, and a crack shown in sketch, from
one corner of the manhole to the commencement of the hemispherical end
was only temporarily prevented from leaking by a screw-patch, which did
not restore the strength.</p>

<p>The explosion happened when in revolving, the manlid was downwards,
and the lid was driven nearly through the floor, and the shell was rent
from opposite corners of the manhole, and blown through the roof.</p>

<p>The large manhole cut away nearly all the strength on one side, and
the fastenings of the lid were not contrived to compensate at all for
the loss of strength. The constant strain when revolving, also tended
to weaken it. These two causes together were sufficient to account for
the explosion, at the usual working pressure of 12 lbs., although it is
possible that it might have been increased to 35 lbs., as that was the
pressure in the boiler supplying the steam, although the pressure was
regulated by a check valve.</p>

<p>This explosion (and also <a href="#no41-66">No. 41</a> in this
year) clearly show that a mere vessel of steam not exposed to the
fire, or any chance of overheating of the plates, can burst and cause
very great destruction, although there could be no sudden <i>increase of
pressure</i> which is so often supposed necessary to account for the havoc
caused by explosions.</p>

The back of the shell, on the right side, had evidently been
overheated, and had rent along the centre of a bulge, and this rent
had extended along the line of rivets of the transverse seam on each
side, allowing two rings of the plates of the shell to open out flat
as shown. There was a bulge on the plate, on the right side of shell,
corresponding with the one which parted on the opposite side.</p>

the plates are placed in rings. There had been considerable repair
at various times, and just previous to explosion the boiler had been
placed as was supposed in thorough repair, and some new

plates had been put over the fireplace. The first rent appears to have
taken place where one of these plates joined the old work. The rent
quickly extended along a straight seam, and the boiler was blown into
three pieces. The explosion was simply caused by the boiler having been
weakened by frequent repair until unable to bear the ordinary working
pressure. Externally fired boilers, when so frequently patched become
treacherous and uncertain, and more especially so when the seams run

rigid as double angle iron and had evidently strained the chimney tube.
This weakness had been so increased by deep corrosion just at the bend
of the plates that it had given way. The havoc and loss of life was far

<p>Revolving Rag boiler, 16ft. long, 6ft. diameter, 7/16 in. plates.
There was no fire applied to the boiler itself, but it received steam
through one end from other ordinary boilers at 50 lbs. pressure. There
were two large rectangular manholes for putting in and taking out the
rags, with cast iron frames and lids, attached by bolts with large nuts
or clamps.</p>

<p>The explosion appeared to have taken place when, in revolving, the
manlids were approaching the bottom, and the first part to give way was
at one of the manholes where the frame was previously broken. The cause
of the explosion was the weakness of the manholes, which were very
large, and both in the same line, and the attachment of the lids was
insecure, as the bolts did not go through the lids, or in any way help
to compensate for the large portion of the plate cut away. The boiler
was only supported at each end, and had to act as a hollow girder to
bear not only its own weight but the repeated shocks of the heavy
material inside falling over and over in addition to the pressure. See

<p>There had originally been a breeches tube in the boiler with a
strong stay to the front end, but when this was taken out no stays
were put to the flat end to compensate for the loss of their support.
The angle iron attaching the flat end was made in four pieces instead
of being welded, and it was reduced to 3/16 inch thick by external
corrosion, so that it was not strong enough to bear the ordinary

would give. The fire also acted on the sides of the boiler without any
intervening brickwork. If a closed top boiler is used, there should be
a dead weight safety valve to prevent pressure. A far safer plan is to
have the kitchen boiler with open top and the circulating heater within
it, so that it can never get overheated, as it only obtains its heat
from the water in the open boiler.</p>

allowing of a slight movement with varying pressure which facilitates
the corrosion in certain lines of strain called "furrowing." In this
case they were so close to the angle iron and filled with scale that
they were difficult to detect.</p>

Tube 3ft. diameter, 3/8 inch plates, 40 lbs. pressure. Gave way at
mid-feather wall where corroded to 1/32 inch, at a place where flues
were too narrow to enter. Two rings of plates were torn out and
blown into an adjoining street, while the reaction of the escaping
contents forced the boiler into a building in a very singular manner,
doing very great damage. This case is of peculiar interest, because
although the cause of explosion was so plain to see, all the old
theories of decomposition of steam, and ignition of hydrogen, were
revived, and it was even stated that "a bad boiler could not
explode, as the corroded part would give way, and allow the
steam to escape harmlessly," and any cause seemed to be considered
more probable than the plain and simple one, that it was
corroded to the thickness of card board. Like many other examples
this explosion shows that however well a boiler is tended, it should
be examined in the flues to make sure that it is safe.</p>
